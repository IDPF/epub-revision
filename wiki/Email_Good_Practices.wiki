#summary Guidance for email messaging.

= Introduction =

A particular email discussion thread within the EPUB Working Group involved a quoting method based on colors instead of the usual "leading angle bracket" (or other editing practice based on plain text markers or tags). This resulted not only in lack of accessibility for persons with visual impairments (e.g. screen reader users), but also in readability breakage for sighted users, due to the Google Groups archiving system displaying only plain-text messages, and not being able to "fold" quoted text because of the absence of citation markers within the prose.

A warning flag was consequently raised (see link below), which prompted a consensus to publish and use some form of emailing guidance. It is quite clear that the quality of the public email archive is important, so that retrospective readings of discussion threads lead to a clear understanding of what member was/is in favor of what side of the argument. Furthermore, it is common practice amongst other standards organizations to back-up formal decisions made within the working group by citing / linking to specific messages in the archive.

This wiki page aims at compiling relevant information, possibly by pointing to already-established standards (or formal guidelines) published by other organizations. The expected outcome is a comprehensive but hopefully simple (and minimal) set of email authoring rules.

*Discussion List Protocols and Etiquette*

After many years of participating on discussion lists, several suggestions pop up time and time again.  We have tried to capture the most common recommendations that can be used as suggestions for discussion list guidelines.  The guidelines are listed first as a short list followed by more information on each.

  # Keep the discussions friendly. Use `(grin)` and `(smile)` in your email if tone could be mistaken. Don't use `:-)`.
  # If you change topics - change the Subject Line.
  # Try to include just one thought topic per email.
  # Delete any unnecessary or unrelated lines from the original message. Retain information necessary to follow the thread.
  # If new text is inserted within the body of the Old message, mark all new text with author's initials enclosed in angle brackets, e.g. `<GV>`  or `<GK>`. At the end put: `</gv>` or `</gk>`). BE CONSISTENT so that a person using a screen reader can use text search to find all your comments.
  # Do not use indenting to show organization of thought or material unless you also include Outline Labels such as 1,2,3 and a b c, or full word labels.
  # Put two blank lines before titles to make them easier to find both visually and via search.
  # Send these recommendations to new list subscribers. (And repeat as necessary).
