#summary Guidance for email messaging.

= Introduction =

A particular email discussion thread within the EPUB Working Group involved a citing method based on colors instead of the usual "leading angle bracket" (or other editing practice based on plain text markers). This resulted not only in a lack of accessibility for persons with visual impairments (e.g. screen reader users), but also in total breakage of readability for sighted users, due to the Google Groups archiving system displaying only plain-text messages, and not being able to "fold" quoted text due to the absence of citation markers within the prose.

A warning flag was consequently raised [1], which prompted a consensus to publish and use some form of emailing guidance, so that group members could adhere to accepted authoring practices.

This wiki page aims at compiling relevant information, possibly by pointing to already-established standards (or formal guidelines) published by other organizations.
