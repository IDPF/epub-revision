#summary This page is an alternate grouping of metadata requirements.
<wiki:toc max_depth="5" />

This is an attempt to help focus the metadata subgroup by representing the listed requirements as groups, based on the apparent type of solution. The grouping is subjective and open to edits and comments.

If this grouping is approved by the metadata subgroup on the 9/14 call, this page will also have requirements originating in other subgroups added. Solution proposals will also be tracked here.
