=== Name of link element ===
[http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/3498180731fb8810 thread]

{{{
I think that the meta and link pair already looks too similar to RDFa. 
I propose to rename link as externalRef. This is because we do not use 
link elements such as  <link rel="marcrel:aut" href="#creator">, which is 
common in RDFa, but we only use something like 
<link rel="onix-record" href="http://example.org/onix/12389347"/> 
}}}

=== Additional prefix mappings ===
[http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/3498180731fb8810 thread]

{{{ 
First, I propose to predefine even more prefixes [...]. Possible additions are FOAF (foaf:), PRISM (prism:), 
PRISM Inline Markup (pim:), PRISM Rights Language (prl:),  PRISM Aggregator 
Message (pam:), PRISM Usage Rights (pur:), PRISM Controlled Vocabulary (pcv:).
