#summary A list of concerns about fixed layout for the IDPF EPUB Workshop for Fixed Layout in Taipei on 2011-10-25

= Introduction =

In preparation to the [TaipeiFixedLayoutWorkshop IDPF EPUB Workshop for Fixed Layout in Taipei on 2011-10-25], a list of generic requirements for fixed layout is presented. It is hoped that this list allow IDPF to understand existing mechanisms or upcoming proposals for fixed layout and compare different mechanisms or proposals. 


Feedbacks to this list are very welcome.  Additions or modifications are also very welcome, but please contact the facilitator, MURATA Makoto (eb2m-mrt atmark asahi-net.or.jp), in advance.



= C1: Device-dependence =

Fixed layout EPUB publications intended for a certain device should reasonably well for other devices.  In particular, even when the screen size is different, the result should be reasonable.  The corpus of fixed layout EPUB publications should not strongly discourage device manufactures from inventing devices with new form-factors.

Since use of Javascript is likely to decrease device-independence, it should be possible to provide fixed layout without relying on Javascript.

Differences of fonts available in reading systems should not ideally lead to different results for fixed layout EPUB publications without embedded fonts.

= C2: Light-weight =

If we would like EPUB to replace CBX/CBR for fixed layout manga, we should provide light-weight EPUB.  We should not force implementers to support what they do not need.

= C3: Avoiding Unnecessary Fragmentation =

There are several methods for achieving fixed layout in EPUB3.
Different methods for different genres may be fine, but more than one method for a single genre (e.g., magazines) may 
multiply implementation and authoring efforts and hamper interoperability.  Subsetting EPUB3 for 
some fixed-layout genre may also cause fragmentation, since implementations dedicated to such subsets might appear.

= C4: Accessibility ==

Allowing accessibility is always crucial to EPUB.  Fixed layout should not hamper but rather enhance accessibility.  However, one way to provide fixed layout is to represent text with images, and such images likely to hamper accessibility.  See  M1C but also M1A1 and M1B1 in [TaxonomyOfMechanismsForFixedLayout#M1:_Mechanisms_for_specifying_fixed_layout M1: Mechanisms for specifying fixed layout].
