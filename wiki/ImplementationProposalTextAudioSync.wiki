#summary Implementation proposal for text/audio synchronization

= Introduction =

This is the wiki page for working on the text/audio synchronization feature in EPUB.  This work will produce an implementation proposal.  

Current status is INCEPTION phase.

= Scope = 

In order to get a better idea of the solution scope, we must first decide which are the relevant requirements, and what are some existing use cases and approaches for these requirements.

== Which of [RichMediaAndInteractivity these requirements] should be covered? ==

== Examples ==
From the list above (once somewhat finalized), list real-world examples for each requirement.  If possible, a single requirement should have more than one example.

=== RM-13: Parallel audio clips [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-13._(C)_Parallel_audio_clips (link)] ===

=== RM-14: Triggers [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-14._(A)_Triggers (link)] ===

=== RM-18: Define synchronization points [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-18._(A)_Define_synchronization_points (link)] ===

==== Example #1 ====
DAISY books use SMIL to define (and associate) text fragments and audio clips
{{{
<par>
  <text src="chapter1.html#id1"/>
  <audio src="aud.mp3" 
     clipBegin="0" clipEnd="0:32"/>
</par>
}}}

=== RM-19: Synchronized playback [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-19._(A)_Synchronized_playback  (link)] ===

DAISY book readers synchronize the audio presentation with the text display:

=== RM-20: Text scroll/highlight [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-20._(B)_Text_scroll/highlight (link)] ===

==== Example #1 ====
DAISY book readers highlight the active text while the audio clip is playing:

=== RM-21: Transparent overlay [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-21._(B)_Transparent_overlay (link)] ===

==== Example #1 ====

SMIL can offer a synchronized audio "script" that does not impact the main text content:

=== RM-22: Using audio selectively [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-22._(C)_Using_audio_selectively (link)] ===

==== Example #1 ====

DAISY book producers often use one MP3 file and one SMIL file (which acts as a sort of "script" for the audio clips) per chapter.  This idea would also work for having audio 

=== RM-24: Runtime audio options [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-24._(D)_Runtime_audio_options (link)] ===

==== Example #1 ====

DAISY players support a feature called "skippability", which allows users to turn on or off specific classes of items.  Examples are page number announcements, footnotes, producer notes, and asides such as sidebars.
