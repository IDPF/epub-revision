= Scope = 

In order to get a better idea of the solution scope, we must first decide which are the relevant requirements, and what are some existing use cases and approaches for these requirements.

== Which of [RichMediaAndInteractivity these requirements] should be covered? ==

=== Ideas ===
(marisa) 
 * RM-13
 * RM-14
 * RM-18 through RM-25.

 * your ideas

== Examples ==
From the list above (once somewhat finalized), list real-world examples for each requirement.  If possible, a single requirement should have more than one example.

=== RM-18: Define synchronization points [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-18._(A)_Define_synchronization_points (link)] ===

==== Example #1 ====
DAISY books use SMIL to define (and associate) text fragments and audio clips
{{{
<par>
  <text src="chapter1.html#id1"/>
  <audio src="aud.mp3" 
     clipBegin="0" clipEnd="0:32"/>
</par>
}}}

==== Example #2 ====

=== RM-20: Text scroll/highlight [RichMediaAndInteractivity#RM-20._(B)_Text_scroll/highlight (link)] ===

==== Example #1 ====
DAISY book readers highlight the active text while the audio clip is playing (here's a screenshot of highlighted text):
