# This wiki show pros and cons of embedded and external regions.

= Definition =

 * *Top-level publication resource*: Publication resources (see [http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-publications.html#sec-terminology the definition]) referenced directly from some itemref element in the spine element.

 * *Embedded regions*: Region representations embedded within top-level publication resources

Note: Suppose a JPEG file that is directly referenced by an `itemref` element.  This JPEG file is a top-level publication resource.  It cannot have embedded regions.

 * *External regions*: Region representations detached from top-level publication resources



= Option 1: External regions  =
 
We assume that only a few elements of SVG are allowed as part of external region representations.

== Pros ==

 * Applicable to any type of top-level publication resources or fragments of such resources
 * Positions and dimensions of resources are relative to the size of displayed resources (or fragments)
 * Navigation and rendition mapping based on external regions can be implemented without requiring full SVG processors.

== Cons ==
 * Even if we use SVG elements and attributes wherever possible, there is a risk of reinventing wheels and poor synergy with the Web.

= Option 2: Embedded regions =

== Pros ==

 * Applicable to SVG content documents and also applicable to HTML content documents  (via image maps or embedded SVG)
 * Positions and dimensions of resources are relative to the size of displayed resources (or fragments)

== Cons ==
 * Can navigation and rendition mapping based on internal regions be implemented without requiring full SVG processors?
