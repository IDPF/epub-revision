#summary A list of motivations for fixed layout for the IDPF EPUB Workshop for Fixed Layout in Taipei on 2011-10-25

= Introduction =

In preparation to the [TaipeiFixedLayoutWorkshop IDPF EPUB Workshop for Fixed Layout in Taipei on 2011-10-25], a list of motivations for fixed layout is presented. It is hoped that this list allow IDPF to understand existing mechanisms or upcoming proposals for fixed layout and compare different mechanisms or proposals. 


Feedbacks to this taxonomy are very welcome.  Additions or modifications are also very welcome, but please contact the facilitator, MURATA Makoto (eb2m-mrt atmark asahi-net.or.jp), in advance.

= Motivations =

 # content/design is inherently paginated, i.e. *is* a sequence of final-form pages
  * Manga or comic
  * Picture books
  * Magazines
  * Coobooks
 # content/design requires richness of presentation that can't be delivered in reflowable EPUB
 # explicit intention to optimize for a particular device (e.g. iPad)
 # economically infeasible to do anything other than replicate print / leverage PDF production workflows
We think that, over time, EPUB's increasing layout capabilities (inc. AAL) will diminish #2 (publishers are already learning to go beyond paper-centric information designs), device proliferation will diminish #3, and better tools (e.g. w/ native AAL support) will diminish #4.
