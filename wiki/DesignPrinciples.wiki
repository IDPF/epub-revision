#summary Design principles and guidelines for the EPUB 2.1/3.0 (aka "EPUB++") revision

_ THIS IS AN EARLY INCOMPLETE DRAFT _

 # *Maximize upwards compatibility*, i.e. existing EPUB 2.01 standard should be valid in EPUB++, although there may be exceptions if required to solve the problems we are tasked to address, and some EPUB 2.01 markup could be deprecated in EPUB++ (e.g. DTBook basic content).
 # *Maintain content accessibility as an overriding goal*: while  new capabilities such rich media and interactivity, and content types such as digital textbooks and magazines, will bring inherent challenges in re: accessibility, it remains critical that, in supporting these new  capabilities and content types, accessibility be maximized.
