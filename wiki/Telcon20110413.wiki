Issue 107, Picking up after Murata's earlier request for postponing a decision

_ Editor's clarifying introductory notes: _
 * _ EPUB3 does *not* relax (as compared to 2.0.1) the rules for resources having to be in the container _
 * _... with the exception of *audio* and *video*, which may be located outside the container, but must still be represented in the manifest_
 * _ the reason for making this exception exclusively for audio and video was: *size* _


* Input from CJK on this issue (on: Murata)
