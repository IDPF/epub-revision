#summary Preliminary Info about De Jure Standardization of EPUB

= Introduction =

This page contains some preliminary thinking about priorities for making EPUB a de jure (ISO-level) International Standard.

= IDPF Goals for De Jure Standardization (DRAFT) =

  * Ensure specifications remains freely available (in some form)
  * Ensure specification's free-to-use status is not encumbered
  * Enable IDPF to continue to add capabilities to the EPUB base standard in a timely manner (i.e. w/out de jure standards group overhead) to meet needs of our members (such could be appendices or extensions to the base)
  * Minimize/avoid incompatible technical changes in the process of creating a de jure standard, in interests of retaining compatibility/interoperability
  * Automatic links to other wiki pages
  * Not create a huge effort for IDPF staff/volunteers/members in the process 
  * Achieve a high-quality / well-regarded standard
  * Achieve an ISO-level International Standard in a relatively timely manner (understanding that it will take time, esp. given unfinished status of several dependent W3C specs).
  * Decide on a particular path to get to ISO-level status during 2011, to make sure to focus efforts and be able to clearly communicate the expected process.
