#summary Possible outcomes for fixed layout

== Introduction ==

In preparation to the [TaipeiFixedLayoutWorkshop IDPF EPUB Workshop for Fixed Layout in Taipei on 2011-10-25], a list of possible outcomes for fixed layout is
presented.

Feedback on this list is welcome. Additions or modifications are
also very welcome, but please contact the facilitator, MURATA Makoto
(eb2m-mrt atmark asahi-net.or.jp), in advance.

== PO1: EPUB extension modules ==

EPUB3 is a collection of specifications.  In this approach, more
specifications for EPUB fixed layout are created.  Ideally, it should
be possible to use such extension modules without changing EPUB3
specifications or breaking conformance to EPUB3.

== PO2: New vocabularies ==

EPUB3 already allows the use of vocabularies such as
[http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/ Structural Semantics Vocabulary].  In this approach, more vocabularies for EPUB fixed layout
are created.  Existing EPUB3 specifications need not be revised.

== PO3: Subsets or conformance classes ==

In this approach, additional specifications are created for those
EPUB3 publications which represent fixed layout.  To be precise, such
specifications define either profiles (i.e, subsets the set of
conformant EPUB publications) and/or conformance classes (i.e., small
collections of requirements on reading systems).

== PO4: EPUB 3.0.X ==

Although the other approaches should be pursued wherever possible, it
might be necessary to introduce some mechanisms to EPUB 3.0.X.
