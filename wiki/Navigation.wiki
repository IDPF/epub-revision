== Mission ==
This sub-group is tasked to update NCX for EPUB 2.1, resolving all known issues and shortcomings with the current EPUB NCX, and introducing new requested NCX features in collaboration with the ongoing DAISY revision (ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2011).

The subgroup is addressing problem 6 in "Current Industry Problems" in the charter: [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html]

Relevant lightning talks from the f2f:  [F2F201006Agenda#Navigation]

== Requirements ==
=== Increase the efficiency of the NCX grammar for the EPUB context ===

==== NAV_R01 Maximize terseness ====
_Rationale: The NCX size can become an obstacle in implementations that need to load the entire DOM._

*Requirement: In the redesigned NCX, ensure that terseness of the XML grammar is maximized.*

----

==== NAV_R02 Lazy/Partial loading of navMap ====
_Rationale: Even where the terseness is maximized in the NCX XML representation, the representation of an entire navMap can exceed available memory in a reading system._

*Requirement: The specification must define the behavior for partial/lazy loading of navMaps.*

----

==== NAV_R03 Remove inapplicable NCX features ====
_Rationale: The EPUB 2.01 NCX grammar contains constructs that, given the direct lift-over from DAISY of the NCX DTD, do not apply to the EPUB usage context. Some of these features were made optional in the 2.01 update; now is the time to get rid of them for real._

*Requirement: In the redesigned NCX, ensure that no inapplicable features are included.*

----

=== Enhance Metadata ===		
==== NAV_R04 Add a mechanism for machine-readable metadata in NCX ====
_Rationale: The NCX grammar currently lacks machine-readable metadata to describe that nature of collections of, or individual, links._

*Requirement: Add constructs that allow the expression of machine-readable metadata in the NCX*

----

===== NAV_R04_1 Describe nature/semantic of the destination =====
*Requirement: NAV_R04 must be implemented so that it allows the expression of the nature/semantic of the link destination*

_ Example: this navList contains a collection of links that refer to all page breaks in the publication _

----

===== NAV_R04_2 Allow distinguishing links along other axes than that of destination nature =====
*Requirement: NAV_R04 must be implemented so that it allows the distinguishing of navLists and navItems along other axes than that of the destination semantics.* 

_Use case: An NCX ships with multiple navLists that describe the pagebreak semantic; each navList representing the location of pagebreaks in different editions of the same work._

----

=== Enchance i18n support ===

==== NAV_R05 Enhance global language support in labels ====
_Rationale: The current NCX (human readable) labels for links and groups of links are limited in their i18n support (xml:lang and dir('rtl'|'ltr') are the only supported properties) _

*Requirement: Add support for inline markup in NCX labels that at minimum supports Ruby and the specification of spans of text (for bdo)*
