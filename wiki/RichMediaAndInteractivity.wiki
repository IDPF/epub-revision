== Mission ==

The subgroup is addressing problem 1 in the charter: http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html 

== Deadlines ==

  * Collect requirements: July 23rd, 2010

== Requirements ==

=== Rich Media ===

==== RM-1. Video and Audio embedding ====

Ability to embed video and audio in the document content declaratively (i.e. without a bunch of javascript around it). Declarative part is important because particular player interface might be fairly different on different devices, e.g. video may have to be played in full-screen or on a separate color screen in dual-screen devices.

==== RM-2. Video and Audio formats ====

We need to come up with some language on what formats should be targeted for interoperability.

==== RM-3. Package A/V with the document ====

Ability to include audio & video within the ePub.  Some content could be considered 'critical' for the ePub experience, and should be included in the ePub.

==== RM-4. Stream A/V from a server ====

Ability to stream audio & video from an external server.  Some content could be considered optional, and can be streamed from an online server. In some cases, it may also be impractical to include longer clips with epub itself.

==== RM-5. Cache online media content ====

For content that is available online, there is a need to have metadata to define if content can be cached on the device (providing the device has the storage capability).  A use case I can imagine is that the device, when detecting that WIFI is present, may offer the user to download all cacheable content, so they can consume it when the wifi is not present.

==== RM-6. Searchable meta data for media content ====

Ability to include searchable meta data for media content, to aid search.

==== RM-7. Accessible version ====

Ability to provide accessible version (i.e. transcripts of media for deaf users).  Related to the search requirement above.

==== RM-8. Media rights ====

Consideration / recommendations around how to post / share media content from ePub.  This may be the wrong subgroup for this discussion, but I do think it is something to be aware of.

==== RM-9. Standalone audio/video ====

Ability to include discrete audio clips: play once in dedicated player, e.g. when play button is clicked

==== RM-10. Synchronized audio ====

Ability to include synchronized audio clips, where:
 * synchronization points are pre-defined as a clip of audio together with a chunk of text or an image, with the audio being a spoken version of the text or image description.
 * synchronized playback follows the natural reading order but is repositioned when the user navigates (via TOC, bookmarks, or other methods).
 * the text scrolls to follow the audio playback, with an option to highlight current text chunk.
 * the synchronized audio feature exists as a transparent overlay so that it does not impact a text-only reading system.
 * synchronized audio can be applied to select portions (islands) of the document, or to the entire thing.
 * audio playback reflects the user's preferences (e.g. turn off page number announcements, follow footnotes automatically).
 * a single publication contains different synchronization granularities (e.g. word, sentence, and paragraph-level).

==== RM-11. Background audio ====

Ability to include looping audio clips (i.e background music for chapter/ book)

==== RM-12. Playlists ====

Ability to include playlists (background music album for book).  

==== RM-13. Parallel audio clips ====

Ability to include multiple parallel audio clips. For instance, there may be audio in both English & French.  This is particularly useful for people learning languages.

==== RM-14. Triggers ====

Ability to define when audio/video should start playing, e.g. (1) on loading book/chapter/page (2) upon the asset becoming 'visible' on the screen.

==== RM-15. Abridged audio ====

For synchronised audio, ability to define text that is NOT in the audio.  This is useful for abridged audio, whereby paragraphs or pages are not included in audio. *Editor's note: I am unclear on this, needs to be clarified*

==== RM-16. Fallbacks based on capabilities ====

Ability to define media fallback for consumption.  For instance, if the device has a wifi connection and capabilities, stream HD video from server.  Otherwise, stream medium-res video from server.  Otherwise, load low-res video from ePub.  Otherwise, display image with caption.

=== Interactivity ===

*Editor's note: we'll need to drill down into it, not assigning numbers yet *

Ability to add *interactive* media to ePub. Including either interactive canvas or svg elements is becoming increasingly valued by customers (for instance, Alice on iPad)

Ability to respond to user input (example use cases):
* A coloring book page allowing the user to "pick up" a "crayon" of some color and draw in a some area
* Should changes persist for the duration of the open book?
* Control an astronomy simulation of the solar system
** Change time scale, change gravitation constant, change mass of planets, ...
* Mathematica-style graphing based on user input
* Quizzes for textbooks
** Submit results to instructors?

Allow imperative coding. HTML5 Canvas, for example, relies on the ability to manipulate drawing via JavaScript.
