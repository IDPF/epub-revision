#page for ad hoc group to work on rendition metadata vocabulary.

= Mission =
The group specifies rendition metadata vocabulary which is used not only for fixed layout books but also text reflowable books.
The rendition metadata should be designed to provide content creators' intention how the title or the page should be displayed to Reading Systems. And the Reading systems which are capable to support defined renditions should utilize the information to display the title appropriately.
