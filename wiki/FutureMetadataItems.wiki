_A way to distinguish between "the main body" of book content and "after-matter."_ The driving force behind this for B&N is the need to have something in an ePub that helps publishers communicate to a Reading System a place, in some types of books (e.g., novels), where “the interesting content ends.” 

I realize this is a rather fuzzy notion; the basic idea is to afford an opportunity to know when someone has reached the end of “the story” but has not yet reached the “end of the book.” Knowing this as a spine item allows us to compute the last page.

Without being too “novel-specific,” I suggest a new manifest *item* property, called *“last-content-item”* (feel free to suggest a more appropriate name). It’s in the same semantic category (in my opinion) as *cover-image*, hence the suggested placement in item. In the specific case I imagine here, this would be applied at most once to the spine item corresponding to the “last chapter of the story.”
