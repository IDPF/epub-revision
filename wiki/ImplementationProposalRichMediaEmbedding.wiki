== Proposal 1 ==

Use HTML5 audio, video, and source elements to embed audio/video streams in the OPS content. HTML5 defines attributes that provide limited control over how video/audio is handled (autoplay, loop, and controls). It also provides source element that provides a set of capability-based fallbacks. Unlike other OPS element, audio and video elements should be specifically allowed to reference external content, providing a way to stream content from the server.

If HTML5 spec is not ready in time, we can take these 3 elements in ops namespace.
