#summary Proposed modifications to EGLS subgroup recommendation

= Proposed modifications to EGLS subgroup recommendation =

This document contains comments to http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~eb2m-mrt/epub/rec2WG.html

Main problem: there is no consensus in the overall WG about relationship to CSS3. The discussion in the WG is captured [CSS3Relations]. EGLS recommendation must be formulated without second-guessing the direction on CSS3.

== Recommendation A ==

Introduce an OPF-namespaced metadata element that indicates preferred document page progression direction (left-to-right or right-to-left) and writing mode (vertical or horizontal).

Rationale: spine defines ebook structure, not presentational/medadata aspects. This information belongs to metadata.

== Recommendation B ==

Incorporate the following properties from _CSS Writing Modes Module Level 3_ (http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text-layout/ ):
 * writing-mode (exclude horizontal-bt value)
 * text-orientation (perhaps subsetted)
 * text-combine (only none and upright values)

Exact method of importing CSS3 properties is TBD for overall spec.

Give only general definitions for these properties, excluding any language from the current draft that has any chance to change later. If we want to align with this CSS3 module, content creators need to design documents defensively accepting that details of the implementation may change.

Consider using "display: inline-block; writing-mode: horizontal-tb" as a replacement to "text-combine: upright" and drop text-combine property.
