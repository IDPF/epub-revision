#summary Slides/Abstracts of the June 2010 F2F lightning talks
=Accessibility and EPUB=
Lightening Talk 
George Kerscher and Kenny  Johar
==1. Who Wants Access to eBooks==
 *Blind and low vision (.3.3 of 1%)
 * Dyslexic ( guessing 2%)
 * Learning Disabled (guessing 6%*not all LD require accessibility techniques)
 * Physically disabled, such as quadriplegics 
 * Cognitively disabled

==2. Legal Considerations==
 * United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
 * Laws in countries, such as 508 and 504 in the USA
 * Department of Justice (DOJ)  and settlements
 * Voluntary refusals to not use inaccessible technologies

==3.  The Handshake between semantically Rich, Structured  content and reading systems==
 * Content must be accessible AND  Reading System UI must be accessible
 * Websites for purchasing must be accessible (W3C/WAI Guidelines)
 * Semantically rich  structured content is essential
 * Intelligent reading Systems use the semantics 

==4. Techniques==

* Structure the content using semantics
 * Identify content based on what it is, e.g. a paragraph is not a heading!
 * Order the content for correct reading order, i.e. the way it appears in a DOM
 * Images, flow charts, etc. require short and long descriptions
 * Video must support captioning and descriptive audio channel
 * Interactivity must be accessible, which is a big question
