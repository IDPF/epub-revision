#summary Central page for the development of the detached Cross-Document Linking specification

= Background =

= Working Assumptions =


  * This specification should be developed with a focus on a quicker initial publication rather than attempting to solve more problems/requirements.
  * This specification should reuse existing standards as much as practical.

= Requirements =

== Highest Priority ==

These requirements must be solved in the initial specification:

  * The specification should specify a technique for creating valid URIs ([http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986]) to identify both EPUB and EPUB3 publications
  * The specification must support both EPUB and EPUB3 publications (ideally equally)

== High Priority ==

These requirements must be solved in the initial specification:  

  * The specification should include some techniques to identify "fragments" in EPUB Content Documents inside the publication 

== Medium Priority ==

These requirements may be solved in the initial specification:

  * The specification should define how these URIs should be resolved
  * The specification should include some techniques to identify "fragments" in non-EPUB Content Documents (continuous media, for example) inside the publication 
  * The specification should include techniques for strongly verifying the strength of a link matching a publication or fragment
  * The specification should include techniques for weakly/loosely/fuzzily matching a link to publications or fragments

== Priority TBD ==

Other requirements not yet prioritized:

  * Will M believes that we should strive to create URIs that are human-readable
