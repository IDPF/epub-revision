#summary Proposed solution for separation of data and code

= Introduction =

In many cases an interactive presentation can be thought of some sort of a "widget" that presents some data type. For instance a chess game may be recorded using standard chess move notation and presented as an animation. A slideshow can be recorded as a list of images and played inside a special widget. Widgets many be developed, tested and shared between EPUB authors, who can use them without need to code.

= Details =

Two types of widgets are proposed. We can choose to use only one type or both of them.
