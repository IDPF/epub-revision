#summary Styling and Layout Sub-group Page

= Styling and Layout Sub-group Page =

== Mission ==

Identify styling and layout limitations in the epub spec that can improved or extended using existing or new technologies. We will make specific recommendations as to what styling and layout should be added and how that should be done. We will pay particular attention to current industry needs and weigh any changes against difficulty in use or implementation. This corresponds to [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html item 5 in our charter].

== Sub-group participation ==

There is no required technical requirements for sub-group members (i.e. you don't have to be a CSS wiz), though conversation on the group will, at times, become quite technical. I still encourage participation by members who have a high-level knowledge of styling and layout issues even if they will not be able to offer specific solutions.

== Requirements ==

Note: !RichLayout.pdf is uploaded to the "Downloads" section to illustrate some of these

=== 1 Multiple Display Surfaces ===

==== SNL_R1.1 Selection of CSS Rules for Various Displays ====
 
_Rationale: Different display surfaces have different optimal styling_

*Requirement: Ability to choose different rule sets based on display properties (size, width/height ratio, ppi, etc) and user preferences (font size, night mode, vertical/horizontal text for Japanese)*

Note: this is related to requirement RGLS_MM_06 on [EGLS_requirement_list]

==== SNL_R1.2 Property value calculation based on environment ====

_Rationale: screen real estate needs to be partitioned differently for different displays properties and user preferences_

*Requirement: ability to do simple calculations based on the environment to express things like "half of a viewport plus 10 pixels" or "one and a half of a column width".* 

==== SNL_R1.3 Image/content selection ====

_Rationale: images need to be scaled, cropped, and, in some cases, even selected differently for different display surfaces_

*Requirement: ability to select images (or other content) based on the display environment*

=== 2 Page-level Layout ===

==== SNL_R2.1 Multi-region flow ====

_Rationale: when a unit of presentation is a "page" or a screen (not an only, but primary use case for ebooks), and when screen size is sufficiently large (e.g. a larger hand-held device or a laptop/PC), professionally layed-out content is typically organized in multiple columns with headers, footers, sidebars, pull quotes and other similar layout elements, collectively called "regions"_

*Requirement: ability to partition screen real estate into regions and ability to (a) flow the primary content from one region to the next; (b) push content to occupy a secondary region; (c) move secondary content to a different page if no space for it can be found on a current page without breaking the primary flow; (d) force other content to flow around a region*

==== SNL_R2.2 Fixed (repeatable) content ====

_Rationale: current header/footer support is too limiting_

*Requirement: ability to control positioning of repeatable content on the page*

==== SNL_R2.3 Page elements alignment ====

_Rationale: professionally-done publications pay great attention to lining up various elements of a page/screen to have maximal impact on a reader_

*Requirement: align various elements on a page/screen, such as (a) make sure that body text lines are aligned across columns even when headings, decorations or images are present; (b) align elements in different regions by precisely placing the regions on a page*

==== SNL_R2.4 Region-based styling ====

_Rationale: content sometimes needs to be styled slightly differently when it flows from one region to the next. This is similar to first line or first character styles, but for regions_

*Requirement: assign region-specific styling rules which affect content which flows into those regions*

=== 3 Miscellaneous ===

==== SNL_R3.1 Improved column support ====

_Rationale: Current column support in epub does not provide enough control over specific properties (e.g. column size)_

*Requirement: Ability to specify number of columns, width of columns, gaps between columns and rules in those gaps. Ability to float boxes across columns and indicate if column balancing should be employed are both desirable features*

==== SNL_R3.2 Declarative ====

_Rationale: to make sure that document can be analyzed for search, navigation, accressibility, etc. and so that a viewer for it can be produced for all popular platforms, layout should be described in declarative terms_

*Requirement: Layout should be described without resorting to running embedded imperative code which is impossibe to analyze and not possible to run on all devices*

==== SNL_R3.3 Hyphenation ====

_Rationale: hyphenation is almost always used in printed books._

*Requirement: minimal hyphenation control; including hyphenation dictionaries with the content (similar to fonts)*
