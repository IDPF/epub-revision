#summary Styling and Layout Sub-group Page

= Styling and Layout Sub-group Page =

== Mission ==

Identify styling and layout limitations in the epub spec that can improved or extended using existing or new technologies. We will make specific recommendations as to what styling and layout should be added and how that should be done. We will pay particular attention to current industry needs and weigh any changes against difficulty in use or implementation. This corresponds to [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html item 5 in our charter].

== Sub-group participation ==

There is no required technical requirements for sub-group members (i.e. you don't have to be a CSS wiz), though conversation on the group will, at times, become quite technical. I still encourage participation by members who have a high-level knowledge of styling and layout issues even if they will not be able to offer specific solutions.

== Requirements ==

=== 1 Multiple Display Surfaces ===

==== SNL_R1.1 Selection of CSS Rules for Various Displays ====
 
_Rationale: Different display surfaces have different optimal styling_

*Requirement: Ability to choose different rule sets based on display properties (size, width/height ratio, ppi, etc)*

=== 2 Page-level Layout ===

*TBD*

=== 3 Miscellaneous ===

==== SNL_R3.1 Improved column support ====

_Rationale: Current column support in epub does not provide enough control over specific properties (e.g. column size)_

*Requirement: Ability to specify number of columns, width of columns, gaps between columns and rules in those gaps. Ability to float boxes across columns and indicate if column balancing should be employed are both desirable features*
