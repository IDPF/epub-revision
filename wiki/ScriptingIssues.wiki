#summary Discussion of resolutions to issues related to scripting

_ Note: this page is a drafty discussion area, nothing stated herein are agreed resolutions_

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

== Issues ==
Here are the issues that have surfaced so far with regards to scripting in EPUB:

=== *A* Unrestricted scripting potentially impacts dynamic pagination negatively ===
Reading systems that do dynamic pagination/reflow run into trouble if the DOM can change unpredictably (outside of given, fixed-size rectangles).

=== *B* Not all reading systems support scripting ===
... and nor should we require them to in 3.0.

=== *C* Scripting is potentially harmful for accessibility ===

=== *D* Maximize cross-device content predictability ===
See Design Guidelines: _author content once, consume everywhere, with a predictable user experience_. 

== Solutions ==
=== A ===

TBD - final definition of "chapter-level scripting" and its functional restrictions

Question (MG): if we discern between two types of scripting (chapter-level and rectangle-restrained), should these be machine-distinguisable?
 * EPUBcheck being able to verify that a spine item with chapter-level scripting is properly declared as such in spine/manifest
 * A reading system being able to selectively disable chapter-level scripts (in a document where both types co-exist)

=== B  ===
By emphasizing and recommending the use of scripting for the purposes of progressive enhancement, we say that an EPUB _should_ retain its fundamental informational integrity even when consumed in a reading system with no scripting support.

_ Note: it seems agreed to not require explicit content alternatives/fallbacks for scripted content that is not of a progressive enhancement nature (using for example HTML's noscript element), although such mechanisms would remain allowed. _

_Comment (MG): this is still a serious impediment to D above. Is it completely unthinkable to require reading systems to support at least some level of scripting?_

=== C === 
This is a general problem inherited from the web; we do not plan to introduce any special remedial features of our own here, but instead rely on solutions from the web space (referencing WCAG guidelines, supporting ARIA markup). See also the solution for {B} above.
