	The number of rooms available in this hotel is less than
	20, since it is a small hotel.  If you do need a room
	in this hotel, make a reservation as soon as possible.

	Information about other hotels are available at many
	web sites including the two sites shown above.

This hotel is fully booked as of July 12.  You might want to 
try [http://www.arccityhotel.com/english.html Shin-Sapporo ARC City Hotel], which is close to New Sapporo station.  It takes 14 min from this station to Higashi 
Sapporo, and then 8 min from Higashi Sapporo station to Sapporo 
Convention Center.


You might want to try hotels close to Odori station.  
They are much more convenient for sightseeing and 
are even closer to the meeting location.  However, 
three subway lines are available in this station (I'm sure 
you can find information in English).  If you are not like 
me (i.e., you are not lost always), you might want to try hotels around  
Odori station such as

=== Agenda ===

To be announced.  

The EGLS subgroup is expected to finish the first list of EGLS requirements
in July.  In Sapporo, we will study possible solutions to these requirements, but
we might also want to review some of the requirements.

Please contact the coordinator if you 	are willing to give a talk.

=== General information about Sapporo ===
	
	Here are some web sites in English.  I am sure that 
	a lot of information in Chinese and Korean can be easily
	found.
