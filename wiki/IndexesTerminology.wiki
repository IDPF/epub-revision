#summary Working list of terms and definitions for Indexes specification]

= Indexes terminology (draft) =

This is a working list of terms/definitions.  This is not a comprehensive list of all terms related to indexes/indexing (see the [IndexesCharterProposal#Definitions Charter Proposal Definitions] for that) but rather a narrower list with more refined definitions, as they evolve in our work.

 * term = alphanumeric string, representing the indexable item -- e.g., a name, place, concept, topic, or any one of an almost infinite number of things

 * locator = the connection between a term and its occurrence in the text; may be single point or range

 * target = the place in the text (file) that is pointed to by the locator

 * entry = term + locator OR term + cross-reference. For legacy data an entry could include a string of locators

For example, in the entry "dogs, 45", the string "dogs" is the term and the string "45" is the locator

 * parent entry = a higher level entry in an index. For example, a main entry is a parent entry of its subentries, and a subentry is a parent entry of its subsubentries 

 * entry array = a main entry and all of its associated subheadings, locators, cross references and other information.  (A main heading with no subs would technically still be an entry array but only have 1 thing in it)

 * decoration = separate character or string that serves as a modifier on the locator

 * see reference = directs the user to a correct location in the index  (see references to terms in other indexes, e.g. “See Smith, John in title index”, are subsumed under this as being functionally the same)

 * see also reference = directs the user to a different location in the index where there is additional relevant information (see also references to terms in other indexes, e.g. “See also Smith, John in title index” are subsumed under this as being functionally the same)

 * generic cross-ref = may need to consider different name that better reflects what it is, such as “link collection”? “group cross-ref”?  “links with multiple arcs”?  Not the same as entry array; the desired behavior may be different, so need to semantically distinguish.  This might not be the best name for it, but basically this would be for generic cross-references, like “see specific state names” to allow them to display a clickable list of all the relevant state names, if desired.
