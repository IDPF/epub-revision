#summary Working list of terms and definitions for Indexes specification]

= Indexes terminology (draft) =

This is a working list of terms/definitions.  This is not a comprehensive list of all terms related to indexes/indexing (see the [IndexesCharterProposal#Definitions Charter Proposal Definitions] for that) but rather a narrower list with more refined definitions, as they evolve in our work.

<wiki:toc depth="2"/>

== decoration ==

Separate character or string that serves as a modifier on the locator, or different formatting that serves as a modifier of the locator.  May be hard-coded into the text, or generated using CSS based on locator target type (e.g., figure, chart, statute, etc.)

== entry ==

Term + locator OR term + cross-reference. For legacy data an entry could include a string of locators

For example, in the entry "dogs, 45", the string "dogs" is the term and the string "45" is the locator

== entry array ==

An entry (at any level) and all of its associated subentries, locators, cross references and other information.  (A main heading with no subs would technically still be an entry array but only have 1 thing in it)

== specific-term cross-reference ==

A see or see also reference that refers to one or more specific entries, for example "See Smith; Jones; Jackson"

== generic-term cross-reference ==

A see or see also reference that refers to a class of entries, for example "See specific ship names."  This type of cross-reference may be actionable or non-actionable.

== group break navigation data ==

A string of hyperlinked letters and/or digits (e.g., A-Z, 0-9) used to easily navigate to another section of the index: for example, clicking P would take the user to the section of the index beginning with P. Other alphabets and character systems would display the appropriate glyphs for any navigation data. 

== index body ==

The portion of the index that is the groups, if any, and the entry arrays.

== index head ==

The portion of the index that contains the title, legend, head notes, alphabetical order examples, group break navigation data , etc. which precedes the index body. (index front matter)

== locator ==

Consists of two parts: (1) actionable character string or image (2) URI.  It can also have an optional (3) target type, to indicate whether a locator points to a figure, a table, a federal statute, and so on.

== parent entry ==

A higher level entry in an index. For example, a main entry is a parent entry of its subentries, and a subentry is a parent entry of its subsubentries 

== see also reference ==

Directs the user to a different location in the index where there is additional relevant information (see also references to terms in other indexes, e.g. “See also Smith, John in title index” are subsumed under this as being functionally the same)

== see reference ==

Directs the user to a correct location in the index  (see references to terms in other indexes, e.g. “See Smith, John in title index”, are subsumed under this as being functionally the same)

== target ==

The piece of content that is pointed to by the locator. It can be either a single point or a range of text.

== term ==

Character string, representing the indexable item -- e.g., a name, place, concept, topic, or any one of an almost infinite number of things
