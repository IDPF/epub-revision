== Functional Requirements ==
_in order of priority_

This provides more specific direction to address a large subset of our original requirements listed above. One underlying assumption is that all new features should be implementable on top of the modern browser engines, without need to rework their internals.

=== 1. Integrate with subset of CSS3 Regions and CSS3 Exclusions ===

This is a portion of "SNL_R2.1 Multi-region flow". There are two new CSS Level 3 Modules: [http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/ CSS Regions]  and [http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-exclusions/ CSS Exclusions]. These modules are still in the early stages on the standardization track, but there are already implementations being done.

CSS Regions introduce a concepts of flow and region. Flow is a sequence of content (potentially from many parts of the document) and region is an area where flow can be presented. Flow can go from one region to the next, much like content flows from one column to the next in multi-column layout.

CSS Exclusions define a way to position an exclusion area (generalization of CSS2 float) and give it a more complex shape (not just a rectangle).

Implementation of these specifications becomes much simpler if it is limited to only apply to the components of a page master (see next subsection), hence a proposal to subset it.

=== 2. Define concept of page masters and page master selection ===

This is a remaining portion of "SNL_R2.1 Multi-region flow".

=== 3. Define "variables" and property calculation ===
