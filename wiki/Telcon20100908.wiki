=== Proposal ===

_EPUB 3.0 distinguishes between content conformance, for creating EPUB 3.0 documents, and Reading System conformance, for reading EPUB 3.0 documents._

For constructs, features, or syntax added to or modified in EPUB 3.0:
 * Conformant EPUB 3.0 content MUST use the *new* construct/syntax/feature.
 * Conformant EPUB 3.0 Reading Systems MUST recognize and process both the old 2.0 and new 3.0 construct/syntax/feature .
 * EPUB 2.0 constructs/syntax/features will be modified only if the modifications do not break upwards compatibility (i.e. retain, as much as possible, the ability of an EPUB 2.0 Reading System to read an 3.0 EPUB document) {1}.  For example, this goal would likely obviate the "simple EPUB with no OPF and no NCX" direction, as a 2.0 Reading System couldn't find the first page, without a "spine" in the OPF.  Whereas, relaxing the "no padding at the end of mimetype" rule, might be fine, as known 2.0 reading systems are more lenient here.

New constructs, features, or syntax in EPUB 3.0:
 * SHOULD be designed with upwards compatibility in mind {1}; which we could qualify with for example
  * SHOULD follow the XHTML 1.1 fallback rule of "ignoring unrecognized content, and continue processing its children"
  * MUST never shadow or interfere with requirements or logic from the EPUB 2.0 specifications
  * SHOULD require a bundled CSS definition for its rendering (aka content conformance requirement not to omit style info for new elements in OPS), where applicable

_Note that these are guidelines that we *may* sacrifice on a case-by-case basis._

{1} We acknowledge the fact that we will not be able to qualify this fully empirically. Whether a certain construct/syntax/feature breaks upwards compatibility will sometimes be a matter of common-sense judgement, and sometimes a matter of reports based on testing a subset of existing Reading Systems, but it will never be a fact determined with 100% accuracy. We also need to define "break". 

Notes, comments:

This would mean that all 2.01 EPUB documents will not _necessarily_ be valid EPUB 3.0 documents (as content conformance definitions would vary between these two specs). But, through reading system conformance statements in the 3.0 spec, 3.0 reading systems would be required to support 2.0 content. (Example: an EPUB with DTBook or XML islands is not valid according to 3.0 content conformance, but a 3.0 reading system must still recognize and process these).
