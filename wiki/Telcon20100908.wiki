=== Proposal ===

_EPUB 3.0 distinguishes between content conformance and reading system conformance._

For modified features in 3.0:
 * 3.0 content conformance allows only the new construct
 * 3.0 reading system conformance requires recognizing the old construct
 * Modifications of 2.0 expressions is limited to those that do not break upwards compatibility (a.k.a the ability of a 2.0 reading system to read a 3.0 EPUB) {1}

For entirely new features in 3.0:
 * New features added to EPUB 3.0 should be designed with upwards compatibility in mind {1}; which we could qualify with for example
  * should be able to fall back from using the XHTML 1.1 rule of "ignoring unrecognized content, and continue processing its children"
  * must never shadow or interfere with 2.0 logic
  * where applicable, require a bundled CSS definition for its rendering (aka content conformance requirement not to omit style info for new elements in OPS)

_Note that these are guidelines that we *may* sacrifice on a case-by-case basis._

{1} We acknowledge the fact that we will not be able to qualify this fully empirically. Whether a certain expression breaks upwards compatibility will sometimes be a matter of common-sense judgement, and sometimes a matter of reports based on testing a subset of existing reading systems, but it will never be a fact determined with 100% accuracy. We also need to define "break". 

Notes, comments:

This would mean that a 2.01 EPUB will not necessarily be valid to 3.0 (as content conformance definitions would vary between these two specs). But, through reading system conformance statements in the 3.0 spec, 3.0 reading systems would be required to support 2.0 content. (Example: an EPUB with DTBook or XML islands is not valid according to 3.0 content conformance, but a 3.0 reading system must still recognize these).
