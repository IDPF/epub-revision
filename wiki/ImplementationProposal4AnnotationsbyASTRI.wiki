# Ref 1: IDPF EPub 2.0 standard at http://www.idpf.org/specs.htm
# Ref 2: IDPF EPub 3.0 Requirements at http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/Annotations

= Annotation Storage Format =

Annotations should not alter the content of the original Ebook, thus recording the annotations in a separate file from the original Ebook is preferred.
In the proposal spec below, the annotation content is generated per book per user (i.e. the annotator) base. The following folder structure is suggested for the user generated annotations.
The user may annotate the book using image, audio or video format. The multimedia content is stored in the folder structure below.
