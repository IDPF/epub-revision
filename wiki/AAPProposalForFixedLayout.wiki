#summary AAP proposal for fixed-layout e-books

=Searching for Common Ground with Fixed-Layout eBooks=
==Digital Issues Working Group (DIWG) of the Association of American Publishers, Inc. • October 21, 2011==

Fixed-layout eBooks are important to publishers as we digitize children’s books and other highly-designed titles. Apple and Barnes & Noble have developed early implementations of this concept, and we hope Amazon will soon release details of their new format. Consistent approaches to certain technical issues will greatly facilitate development of the market.
