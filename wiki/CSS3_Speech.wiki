Hello !

The "phonemes" property [1] described in the current Working Draft of 
the CSS3 Speech Module covers functionality that is arguably not 
related to styling. The concept of "phonemes" is inherited from SSML 
[2], and indeed represents an important aspect of speech synthesis. 
However, the relevance of phonetic instructions in the presentation 
layer needs to be discussed.

To bring concrete arguments into this discussion, I would like to cite 
the ongoing revision of the DAISY open-standard (format for Digital 
Talking Books and synchronized text/audio publications). ANSI/NISO 
Z39.86-AI defines a markup grammar [3] that 'adopts' SSML "phonemes" 
to enable the provision of pronunciation instructions on XML elements 
that are not within the SSML namespace. In other words, this 
specification considers that phonetic instructions are part of the 
data layer, not part of styling/presentation. In this case, 
pronunciation information is inlined within the content itself, but it 
could alternatively be provided via some non-CSS out-of-band mechanism.

Additionally, the working group responsible for the ongoing revision 
of the EPUB open-standard (the IDPF industry format for electronic 
publications) is also in the process of drafting the adoption of SSML 
elements for inline use within XHTML markup [4].

Due to the contentious nature of the "phonemes" property in the 
current CSS3-Speech Working Draft, and because of the planned release 
schedule of both aforementioned specification works, I would like to 
strongly urge interested parties to provide feedback as soon as 
possible.

Many thanks !
Regards, Daniel

Re: [css3-speech] Drop mark properties

Also, the 'mark' properties seem to be redundant with using @media 
speech with :before/:after. Claudio, do you remember why it was added?

{{{
h1 {mark-before: "section"}
p {mark-before: attr(id) }
}}}

vs

{{{
@media speech {
    h1:before { content: "section"; }
    p:before { content: attr(id); }
}
}}}

Daniel replies:

If I understand correctly, the purpose of SSML's "mark" element [1] is 
two-fold:

  # provide a destination 'anchor' in the text flow, for the speech synthesizer / processor to address (similar to `<a name="link_target"/>` in XHTML).
  # raise an event when a named "mark" is encountered (trigger asynchronous notification when reaching a pre-authored point in the text/audio flow).

Now, to me this functionality isn't of stylistic nature. I think this 
feature allows authors to define actual *data* (i.e. it does not 
provide a mean to encode presentational instructions for existing 
data). I am therefore in favor to remove the "mark" property from the 
CSS3-Speech Working Draft.
