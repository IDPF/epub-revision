Hello !

The "phonemes" property [1] described in the current Working Draft of 
the CSS3 Speech Module covers functionality that is arguably not 
related to styling. The concept of "phonemes" is inherited from SSML 
[2], and indeed represents an important aspect of speech synthesis. 
However, the relevance of phonetic instructions in the presentation 
layer needs to be discussed.

To bring concrete arguments into this discussion, I would like to cite 
the ongoing revision of the DAISY open-standard (format for Digital 
Talking Books and synchronized text/audio publications). ANSI/NISO 
Z39.86-AI defines a markup grammar [3] that 'adopts' SSML "phonemes" 
to enable the provision of pronunciation instructions on XML elements 
that are not within the SSML namespace. In other words, this 
specification considers that phonetic instructions are part of the 
data layer, not part of styling/presentation. In this case, 
pronunciation information is inlined within the content itself, but it 
could alternatively be provided via some non-CSS out-of-band mechanism.

Additionally, the working group responsible for the ongoing revision 
of the EPUB open-standard (the IDPF industry format for electronic 
publications) is also in the process of drafting the adoption of SSML 
elements for inline use within XHTML markup [4].

Due to the contentious nature of the "phonemes" property in the 
current CSS3-Speech Working Draft, and because of the planned release 
schedule of both aforementioned specification works, I would like to 
strongly urge interested parties to provide feedback as soon as 
possible.

Many thanks !
Regards, Daniel

Re: [css3-speech] Drop mark properties

Also, the 'mark' properties seem to be redundant with using @media 
speech with :before/:after. Claudio, do you remember why it was added?

{{{
h1 {mark-before: "section"}
p {mark-before: attr(id) }
}}}

vs

{{{
@media speech {
    h1:before { content: "section"; }
    p:before { content: attr(id); }
}
}}}

Daniel replies:

If I understand correctly, the purpose of SSML's "mark" element [1] is 
two-fold:

  # provide a destination 'anchor' in the text flow, for the speech synthesizer / processor to address (similar to `<a name="link_target"/>` in XHTML).
  # raise an event when a named "mark" is encountered (trigger asynchronous notification when reaching a pre-authored point in the text/audio flow).

Now, to me this functionality isn't of stylistic nature. I think this 
feature allows authors to define actual *data* (i.e. it does not 
provide a mean to encode presentational instructions for existing 
data). I am therefore in favor to remove the "mark" property from the 
CSS3-Speech Working Draft.

Note: this issue is resolved, but kept here for tracking purposes. The resolution is that CSS3-Speech should only need to reference CSS2.1, and CSS3-Values-and-Units. The other CSS3 Modules such as CSS3-Syntax are not active-enough to be relied upon at this stage.

== Reminders ==

Media type "speech" (introduced in CSS 2) and "aural" (deprecated) => semantically equivalent ("intended for speech synthesizer").

Hi all,

I am in the process of completing a review of the CSS3 Speech Module and its related dependencies, and I came across general statements that seems ambiguous to me. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

In section "7.1.4. Recognized media types" of the CSS-Syntax specification [1], the following normative statement is pretty clear (note the "MUST"):

"A CSS media type names a set of CSS properties. A user agent that claims to support a media type by name must implement all of the properties that apply to that media type. ... The names of media types are normative."

So for example, let's take the CSS-Speech Module [2]: conforming user agents (e.g. web-browsers with screen-reader support) must implements all of the CSS Properties marked with the "speech" media type. To me, this means that the "Media" field in the description of each CSS Property has a critical normative value: it is the only way for implementors to know, without ambiguity, what properties MUST be handled in order to claim conformance as a user-agent supporting speech-synthesis.

The same remark obviously applies to any other CSS Property, for any other media type normatively specified in CSS3 (e.g. visual, braille, print, etc.).

Yet, in the same section "7.1.4" we read:

"the 'Media' field in the description of each property is informative."

I would have thought that this should be "normative", not "informative". Could one of the CSS-Syntax editors please clarify this ?

Additionally, section "7.1.4" also states:

"Media types are mutually exclusive in the sense that a user agent can only support one media type when rendering a document."

This statement is not problematic in itself, but section "2. Introduction" of the CSS-Speech Module seems to be make a contradictory assertion:

"Style sheet properties for text to speech may be used together with visual properties (mixed media)"

Any thoughts ?

Thank you :)
Regards, Daniel

Well, actually the last part ("the names of media types are  
normative") is in CSS2.1:7.3 "Recognized media types" [1], but  
otherwise you are correct ! This is a confusion on my part due to  
CSS2.1:7.3.1 "Media groups" [2] being 'shifted' to CSS3-Syntax:10.7  
"Media groups" [3] (a long way down from CSS3-Syntax:7.1.4.  
"Recognized media types" [4]). Anyway, I will just pretend the CSS3- 
Syntax Module doesn't exist from now on. :o)

This resolves my first issue.

My second issue (mutual exclusion versus mixed media speech+visual) is  
resolved by virtue of CSS2.1 "Media Groups".

Case closed.
Thanks !
Daniel

Dear all,

The current Working Draft of the CSS3 Speech Module contains a 
normative dependency [1] to the CSS3 Syntax specification draft [2]. 
It is my understanding that CSS3-Syntax is "severely unmaintained" (as 
recently pointed out by Fantasai ;) ), so I propose to replace the 
following statement from "10. Voice characteristic properties" [3]:

"
Names of specific voices may be quoted, and indeed must be quoted if 
any of the words that make up the name does not conform to the syntax 
rules for identifiers [CSS3-Syntax].
"

...with a reference to CSS2.1 identifiers syntax [4] instead.

Any comments and/or objections ?
Regards, Daniel
