Re: [css3-speech] Drop mark properties

Also, the 'mark' properties seem to be redundant with using @media 
speech with :before/:after. Claudio, do you remember why it was added?

{{{
h1 {mark-before: "section"}
p {mark-before: attr(id) }
}}}

vs

{{{
@media speech {
    h1:before { content: "section"; }
    p:before { content: attr(id); }
}
}}}

Daniel replies:

If I understand correctly, the purpose of SSML's "mark" element [1] is 
two-fold:

  # provide a destination 'anchor' in the text flow, for the speech 
synthesizer / processor to address (similar to `<a name="link_target"/>` 
in XHTML).
  # raise an event when a named "mark" is encountered (trigger 
asynchronous notification when reaching a pre-authored point in the 
text/audio flow).

Now, to me this functionality isn't of stylistic nature. I think this 
feature allows authors to define actual *data* (i.e. it does not 
provide a mean to encode presentational instructions for existing 
data). I am therefore in favor to remove the "mark" property from the 
CSS3-Speech Working Draft.
