#summary Implementation proposal for MathML integration in OPS.

= MathML in EPUB =

_I have not added links yets_

EPUB adopts all of MathML 3 with the restrictions listed below. These restrictions limit the MathML to presentation MathML except inside of a semantics element. They also provide guidelines on how fall back images and alternative text should be given.

== Content MathML ==
All content MathML elements should be inside of an annotation-xml element, which in turn is only valid inside of a semantics element.  The markup should look like
{{{
<semantics>
  ... presentation markup ...
  <annotation-xml
}}}

=== Rationale ===
Content MathML is discussed in Chapter 4 of the MathML Specification. It provides a means of specifying the semantics of the expression without saying how those semantics should be displayed.  MathML envisioned that an XSL style sheet that transforms the content MathML into presentation MathML would accompany so that it could be rendered as intended.  An alternative method allowed in MathML is called parallel markup where both the presentation and content markup are given inside of a semantics element. Because XSL is not a part of EPUB, parallel markup should be used when content MathML is used.

== Fallback Images ==

== Alternative Text ==

== Legal Annotation Types ==

== Use of Deprecated Features ==

No deprecated elements or attributes in MathML 3 should be used in an EPUB document.

_Issue:  MathML 3 no longer uses XML:id and xlink:href as these have fallen out of favor.  Used in OPS 2?_
