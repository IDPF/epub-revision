= Scripting Implmentation Proposal =

Defined in ScriptingImplementationProposal.

Two classes of OPF content resources:

  * Non-scripted OPS3 Content: Processing model is defined in OPS 3 (not HTML5)
    * May reference (<iframe>, <object> references as usual, fallbacks required)
  * xHTML5 Content with Scripting: Processing model is defined in HTML5
    * If this xHTML5 content is reference from the <spine> it will be implementation-dependent on how this is processed
    * MAY limited OPS3 features

Each resource <item> MUST specify which of the two classes of OPD content resource the referenced uses.

Rough consensus of support reached. Will discuss at WG.

= Text Audio Sync Implementation Proposal =

Defined in ImplementationProposalTextAudioSync. Described 

Required changes:

  * Add <item> referencing SMIL file(s) 
  * Specify correspondence from <itemref> to one and only one SMIL using @audio attribute
  * Define a schema for a subset of SMIL (3.0?)

SMIL 3.0 subset:
  
  * SMIL file will reference a specific element in the targeted text content using IDs or other fragment ID techniques TBD

This Implementation will use the same techniques for element references as the rest of EPUB3 (Annotations, for example)

Styling:

  * Reading Systems should set and unset a specific CSS class (`audio-active`) to each element as the related audio is played back.

`role` attribute:

  * SMIL files will use the same `role` attribute (or whatever, TBD) for defining semantics as text/other content

Commentary:

  * MAKOTO & others are not entirely comfortable with `#xpath()`/XPointer
  * Peter S feels that the `audio` attribute may need to be renamed to `smil` or `timeline`
  * Peter S feels that we should move to a psuedo-class

Rough consensus of support reached. Will discuss at WG.
