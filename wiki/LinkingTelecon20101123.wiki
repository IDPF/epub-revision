= What =

== Why not DOI? ==

Bill K clarifies that DOI provides uniqueness and persistence, in addition to having defined solutions to changing ownership or changing resources (at the other end). 

Markus G repeats Bill M's question: Why not DOI?

Keith F asks why DOIs haven't appeared in EPUBs already if it's a good solution?

Dan H discusses some of the properties of DOIs that are already standardized: resolvers, tools for disambiguation. He asks that we develop LinkingSolutionProCon.
