 * Normative references or non-normative references?
 * Dated references or undated references?

 * What kind of warning is required?
 * Should we attach the prefix *idpf-* to properties?
 * Should we copy syntactical definitions and/or semantics definitions from non-normative references?
 * IPR issues
