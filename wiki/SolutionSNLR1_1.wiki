= SNL_R1.1_PS1 Media Queries =

Media Queries are used by both HTML5 and CSS3 to determine characteristics of a particular user agent, device and viewport. These queries extend the previous limited list of media previously used by @media, @import and the link element. See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/ for details. Media queries can be used both in the link element of HTML5 and in CSS3 (@media and @import). If we adopt one location, it seems like we should adopt them all.

This solution can address (to varying degrees) use cases 1 to 4. It does not address the specific example in case 5, "`[...]`  displays with poor refresh rates may want to use a static image in place of a video." There is no capability to detect refresh rates in the current media query spec.

Pros:
 # Standards based (being adopted by CSS3 and HTML5), in a fairly stable draft (Candidate Rec)
 # Wide implementation support in existing user agents
 # Conforming 2.0 Reading Systems should ignore styles using these queries, but should still process the remainder of the styles

Cons:
 # Not a final spec
 # May not support all device information we care about
