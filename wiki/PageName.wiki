Note: The first two examples below ('lie') illustrate how the search-results-form content can be used to distinguish two entries with identical search-form spellings. (Remember that while this seems like a nice-to-have feature in an English dictionary, it is an important capability for a Japanese dictionary.)  The third example ('color/colour') serves to show how multiple headwords in the same entry would relate to each other. 

= Approach 1 =
- The display form of the headword is expressed in the text node of the `<headword>` element. 
- The optional search-results-form is expressed as an attribute of `<headword>`. 
- The search-forms of both the headword and its inflections are captured as sibling elements nested within `<headword>`, with the two distinguished via an attribute. These are meant to be values accessible by the reading system, but not displayed to the user.
