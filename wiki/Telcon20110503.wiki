Issue 94

_Summary:_ 
 * requiredModule attribute is dropped
 * requiredNamespace attribute now contains any URI identifier (thus we use same approach as svg:switch)
 * use of css to implement not mandated, but an HTML5 processing model is required: _must be processed as if @hidden was set on all but one child_ (see [http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-switch-processing processing])
 * do not create a list of URIs to identify features/extensions now 


 * [http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-content-switch new spec draft]
 * [http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/48ac936115930a3c Thread]

_if time allows_
