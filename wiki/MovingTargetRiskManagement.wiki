#summary Moving targets referenced by EPUB3

= Introduction =

EPUB3 depends on several moving targets such as W3C working drafts.  This document enumerates these moving targets and also shows our strategy for minimizing risks caused by such moving targets.


= W3C =

 * CSS2.1: Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification
  * Since this spec is expected to finalized soon, there are no significant risks.

 *CSS3Fonts (WD)
  * It is reasonably mature, but not done yet.
  * EPUB CSS Profile uses only a few of the properties in this spec

 *CSS3Lists
  * This specification is immature.
  * EPUB CSS Profile uses only a few of the properties in this spec

 *CSS3Ruby (WD)
  * This specification is immature.
  * EPUB CSS Profile uses only a few of the properties in this spec

 *CSS3Speech (WD)
  * This specification is immature.
  * EPUB CSS Profile uses only a few of the properties in this spec

 *CSS3Text (WD)
  * This specification is immature.
  * EPUB CSS Profile uses only a few of the properties in this spec

 *CSS3WritingModes (WD)
  * This specification is immature.
  * EPUB CSS Profile uses only a few of the properties in this spec

 *CSSMultiCol (CR)
  * Since this spec is expected to finalized soon, there are no significant risks.

 *HTML5 (WD)
  * It is not expected to be finished this year or next year.
  * It is not clear if the HTML5 schemas used by EPUB3 faithfuly capture the latest language design.

 * MediaQueries (CR)
  * Since this spec is expected to finalized soon, there are no significant risks.

 * Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 (Second Edition) (WD)
  * Second edition is only slightly different from the first edition, but there are some technical differences.
  * The schemas used by EPUB3 do not completely capture the second edition.
