#Links to sample indexes of various types for reference

= Introduction =
This page contains links to various types of indexes, for reference by the Indexes Working Group.

PLEASE NOTE: These are NOT intended as examples of how to encode an index, but rather as resources we can refer to during our work in enumerating the atomic elements necessary for the support of many different types of indexes. The question of how to encode them will come later.
