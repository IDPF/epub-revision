#summary Implementation proposal for Rich Media Format

= Introduction =

This wiki page covers an implementation proposal for the "Rich Media" part of the revision of the ePUB standard. It addressess the "Rich Media, Ads and Interactivity" requirements listed in [http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/RichMediaAndInteractivity]. Specifically, it targets the requirement RM-2 which concerns about "the need for rich media and interactivity support" listed in the charter of this working group. In order for the content provider to generate ePUB v3.0 with embedded rich media and for the reader system vendor to support rich media, it is necessary to at least enumerate a list of recommended audio and video formats. Without this basic information, it is next to impossible to perform any interoperable test for any rich media enabled ePUB v3.0 compliant content on the compliant reader system.

== Audio ==
If the ePUB v3.0 reading system supports audio, it MUST support MPEG-1 Layer 3 (mp3). As such, mp3 will be one of the core media types.
  * It is up to the content provider and the reader system to decide the range of supported parameters such as bit rate, sampling frequency etc.
  * MIME media type: audio/mpeg
  * Reference:     IETF/RFC3003: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3003 and ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993: http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_t/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=22412
  * Description: Used for compressed audio 
  * Here is an HTML5-like fragment sample for audio

{{{
<audio id="MyAudioExample">
   <source src="idpf.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
</audio>
}}}     

== Video ==
If the ePUB v3.0 reading system supports video, it MUST support ITU H.264 baseline profile (h264). As such, h264 will be one of the core media types. 
  * The raw H.264 bitstream MUST NOT be present in the ePUB v3.0 package by itself. It must be embedded inside some kind of multimedia container. One possible choice is MPEG-4 system (ISO/IEC 14496-1). There was no consensus on the exact container type in the 20101117Telcon yet. Another option is Matroska (mkv, http://www.matroska.org/). 
  * If the multimedia container is MPEG-4 and there is no audio track inside the container, the MIME media type will be: video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E
     * The codecs parameter adheres to IETF/RFC 4281 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4281)
  * Reference: ITU H.264: http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.264/e
  * Description: Used for compressed video

== Container ==
If the ePUB v3.0 reading system supports video, it MUST support a yet-to-be-specified multimedia container format which will be one of the core media types. This container format supports multiplexing of audio track(s), video track and/or auxiliary data track (e.g. closed caption and/or subtitle) with embedded timing information for synchronized presentation). In addition, if one or multiple audio tracks are present in the multimedia container, the audio MUST be in some compressed format. One suggestion is MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding - Low Complexity (AAC-LC) format. Again there was no consensus on this audio codec format in the 20101117TelCon. 
   * If the MPEG-4 system is the multimedia container format and AAC-LC is the audio compression format, the resulting MIME media type will be: type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'
     * Reference of MPEG-4 System: IETF/RFC4337 (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4337.txt) and ISO/IEC 14496-1 (http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=55688)
     * Reference of MPEG-4 Audio: ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009 (http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42739
     *  Here is an HTML5-like fragment sample for video
