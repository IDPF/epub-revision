#summary Implementation proposal for Rich Media Format

= Introduction =

This wiki page covers an implementation proposal for the "Rich Media" part of the revision of the ePUB standard. It addressess the "Rich Media, Ads and Interactivity" requirements listed in [http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/RichMediaAndInteractivity]. Specifically, it targets the requirement RM-2 which concerns about "the need for rich media and interactivity support" listed in the charter of this working group. In order for the content provider to generate ePUB v3.0 with embedded rich media and for the reader system vendor to support rich media, it is necessary to at least enumerate a list of recommended audio and video formats. Without this basic information, it is next to impossible to perform any interoperable test for any rich media enabled ePUB v3.0 compliant content on the compliant reader system.
