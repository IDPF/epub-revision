#summary Implementation proposal for Rich Media Format

= Introduction =

This wiki page covers an implementation proposal for the "Rich Media" part of the revision of the ePUB standard. It addressess the "Rich Media, Ads and Interactivity" requirements listed in [http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/RichMediaAndInteractivity]. Specifically, it targets the requirement RM-2 which concerns about "the need for rich media and interactivity support" listed in the charter of this working group. In order for the content provider to generate ePUB v3.0 with embedded rich media and for the reader system vendor to support rich media, it is necessary to at least enumerate a list of recommended audio and video formats. Without this basic information, it is next to impossible to perform any interoperable test for any rich media enabled ePUB v3.0 compliant content on the compliant reader system.

= Proposal =
== Audio ==
MPEG-1 Layer 3 (mp3): This will be one of the core media types.
  * It is up to the content provider and the reader system to decide the range of supported parameters such as bit rate, sampling frequency etc.
  * MIME media type: audio/mpeg
  * Reference:     IETF/RFC3003: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3003 and ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993: http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_t/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=22412
  * Description: Used for compressed audio      

== Video ==
ITU H.264 Baseline Profile (h264): This will be one of the core media types.  
  * The raw H.264 bitstream must NOT be present in the ePUB v3.0 package by itself. It must be embedded inside a MPEG-4 container. 
  * MIME media type: video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E
     * The codecs parameter adheres to IETF/RFC 4281 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4281)
  * Reference: ITU H.264: http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.264/e

== Container ==
MPEG-4 system is the mandatory container format and will be one of the core media types. This container format supports multiplexing of audio track(s), video track and/or auxiliary data track (e.g. closed caption and/or subtitle) with embedded timing information for synchronized presentation
   * MIME media type: video/mp4
      * There are two variations because of the presence of the audio track(s)
         * container with video-only: video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E
         * container with video and audio: video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E,mpeg": Please note that I am not sure the codecs parameter here is valid or not. I was not able to locate any example with H.264 baseline video + mp3 audio using RFC 4281 codecs parameter set. I just made one up here for the sake of completeness.
