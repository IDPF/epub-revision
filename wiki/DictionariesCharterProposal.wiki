#summary Charter Proposal, Dictionaries and Glossaries

= Charter Proposal - Dictionaries and Glossaries =
*_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_*

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

== Status of this proposal ==
This is a draft charter proposal, not yet submitted to the IDPF membership for ratification.

== Need for this proposal ==
Dictionaries, glossaries, thesauri, and similar works are ubiquitous published resources that users will expect to have available in the EPUB3 ecosystem.

Publishers of EPUB3 content wish to make these resources available to users and to serve needs that cannot be met by a general monolingual dictionary typically bundled with a reading system: children need dictionaries designed for their reading level, language learners need dictionaries that translate from a foreign language to their native tongue, and users reading material in fields such as medicine and law need dictionaries covering a broad specialized vocabulary.

Reading system developers wish to utilize and innovate around these types of publications.

This proposal describes the scope, required functionality, and timeline to deliver a standard for producing EPUB3 Publications that meet the use cases that are also included in this proposal.


== Scope ==
=== In-scope (Deliverables) ===
The scope of this project is to define a declarative mechanism for the representation of [#dict dictionaries] and [#glossary glossaries] in EPUB Publications. As further detailed in [#Use_Cases Use Cases] and [#Needed_Publication_Properties Needed Publication Properties] below, the delivered mechanism shall have the following top-level functional properties:
 * Allow publishers to embed a glossary in a publication, and allow users to [#lookup look up] terms in the glossary local to that publication
 * Allow dictionary publishers to make a wide range of monolingual dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries, and thesauri available to consumers
 * Allow users to search for [#headword headwords] by entering text in a search field while accessing the dictionary publication
 * Allow users to select the dictionaries that will be their [#preferred_resource preferred resources] for [#lookup lookup] of unfamiliar words while reading
 * Allow users to look up text in dictionary publications while reading, and to obtain results from their [#preferred_resource preferred resources] that are appropriate to the language context of the text selected for lookup
 * Allow reading system developers to innovate around methods for users to set their [#preferred_resource preferred resources] for dictionary [#lookup lookup] (eg, by reading level, by language, preference ordering, etc.)

=== Out of Scope ===
  * low-level, system oriented functionality for fast lookup and retrieval, typically described in terms of a database-like index.

== Timeline and Participation ==

Project participation is open to IDPF members and invited experts. _(Note that invited expert status needs to be renewed for each IDPF project.)_

This project is intended to be run concurrently with the project on [IndexesCharterProposal indexes], and so shares the following timeline with that project:

== Working Group Leads ==
Suggested Leads of this working group are:
 * x _(Chair)_
 * y _(Vice Chair)_



== Use Cases ==
_ Actors: publishers, users _
  * A user opens and interacts with a dictionary publication as they would any other EPUB3 publication.
  * A user selects text in a publication and performs a [#lookup lookup] on that text.
  * A user searches for a term by entering text into a search field, and expects results to be offered from the dictionary publication currently being accessed.
  * A user sets a [#preferred_resource preferred resource] for [#lookup lookup], or sets the order in which [#dictionary_resources dictionary resources] are used when multiple resources are available for lookup.
  * A user sets the default level of detail returned or displayed from [#dictionary_resource dictionary resource] entries.
  * A user sets a default level of detail returned to a screen reader or other AT for the purposes of 'skimming'.
  * A user references a term located in a specific resource for the purposes of citation, annotation, or sharing.
  * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use embedded entries, e.g. a glossary local to publication.
  * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use a specific standalone resource, if available.

_ System: reading system, content_
  * A publication contains an embedded glossary or dictionary, and declares this resource via package metadata. 
  * A publication is a standalone dictionary and declares this in package metadata.
  * A publication contains terms in one or more languages, and declares the available languages and relationships through package metadata.
  * A publication indicates that it has an intended audience, such as users within a certain age range, or students in a specific grade level.


== Needed Publication Properties ==

_ Package Metadata _
  * A publication contains an embedded [#glossary glossary] and declares this resource via package metadata.
  * A publication is a monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary, or thesaurus, and declares this via package metadata.
  * A publication is a bilingual dictionary and declares the languages it covers and the relationships between them via package metadata. 
    * If a bilingual dictionary publication only consists of a French-to-English translation direction (ie, a collection of entries containing French headwords with corresponding English translations), it would need to declare one relationship: French as the [#source_language source language] and English the [#translation_language translation language]. Such a publication contains one [#dictionary_resource dictionary resource]. 
    * If a bilingual dictionary publication contains both French-to-English and English-to-French translation directions (ie, both a collection of entries containing French headwords and their English translations, as well as a collection of entries containing English headwords and their French translations), then two different relationships need to be declared and distinguished in package metadata. A reading system must be able to determine that there are two [#dictionary_resource dictionary resources] present and to distinguish between them.
  * to be added: reading level metadata

_ Entry Structure _
  * to be added

_ Lookup Search _
  * to be added: markup of headwords, inflection semantics; possibly markup for information that should be hidden in a lookup pop-up if a user indicates that preference (related to one of our use cases above) 

_ Text Entry Search _
  * to be added: distinction between search forms (eg, "wind") and display forms ("wind<sup>1</sup>") in markup

_ Miscellaneous Semantic Information _
  * The dictionaries working group needs to determine in the course of development what additional [#Structure_and_Semantics semantic information] needs to be captured in publication markup. 

== Structure and Semantics ==
*N.B.*: The following terms are representative of the range of lexical and semantic qualities that will be needed to support stated use cases and also allow for innovation. For the purposes of this charter proposal to initiate a working group, these terms are not intended to be interpreted as a strict requirement for inclusion into a specification.

== Definitions ==

=====affix=====
 A prefix, infix, or suffix that is attached to another form to make a  word with a distinct meaning, eg, _laugh_ + *ed*.

=====alternate headword=====
 Also known as *variant headword*, an alternate spelling or form of a primary [#headword headword] that should be treated as of equal rank to it for search purposes. For example, an entry with the primary headword 'kabbalah' could have numerous alternate headwords: '*kabbalah* _also_ *kabbala* _or_ *kabala* _or_ *cabala* _or_ ...'

=====antonym=====
 Terms with opposite sense or meaning.

=====cultural note=====
 A note providing detailed cultural context on a [#headword headword].

=====date=====
 The date of the first recorded use in a language of a particular [#headword headword]. 

=====definition=====
 An explanation of the meaning of a particular [#sense sense] of a [#headword headword].

=====dictionary resource=====
 A collection of entries that have headwords in a particular [#source_language source language] and that a reading system can access to look up terms a user selects while reading a publication. 

=====displayed inflection=====
 An [#inflection inflection] of a headword that is part of the viewable content of an entry. Irregular inflections are often explicitly printed in entries to provide guidance to the user, eg, the displayed inflection "mice" in "*mouse* _noun, plural_ *mice*"

=====entry=====
 The fundamental organizational unit of a glossary or dictionary, consisting of at least one [#headword headword] _and_ a [#definition definition], [#translation translation], or [#equivalence equivalence] cross-reference.

=====equivalence=====
 A statement that a headword or particular sense of a headword is equivalent in meaning to another dictionary headword, typically supplied in lieu of a definition and acting as a cross-reference to the equivalent entry cited. An example would be a short entry for *color* in a British English dictionary that informs the user this is a US equivalent of *colour*: '*color* _noun_ _(US)_ = *colour*'.

=====etymology=====
 An explanation of the historical origin of a headword, eg, a statement that it is derived from a particular Latin word

=====example=====
 A sentence or phrase illustrating the usage of a headword in a particular [#sense sense].

=====gender=====
 A label indicating the gender of a noun, generally subsumed in part-of-speech at the beginning of an entry; in bilingual dictionaries, often a stand-alone label associated with a particular [#translation translation]

=====glossary=====
 A glossary section of a publication that a reading system can access to look up a term a user selects while reading that particular publication.

=====headword=====
 The word occurring at the start of an [#entry entry] whose meanings the entry covers. In a monolingual dictionary or glossary, the headword is _defined_, while in a bilingual dictionary the headword is _translated_, and in a thesaurus [#synonym synonyms] are provided. In most languages, entries are arranged alphabetically according to the spelling of the headword. 

=====holonym=====
 A relation between a whole and a part, eg, a wiki is a holonym of constituent wiki pages; 'has-parts'.

=====hypernym=====
 A relation between a class and sub-class; 'has-types'.

=====hyponym=====
 A relation between a sub-class and a class; 'is-type-of'.

=====inflection=====
 An [#affix affixed] form of a headword that conveys a specific grammatical meaning; for example, the past tense of a verb or plural form of a noun. In print dictionaries or glossaries, inflections generally do not have their own entries. In electronic dictionaries, however, inflections users may look up while reading should be associated with their root headwords and stored as non-viewable content. When a user performs a [#lookup lookup] of an inflected form such as "ran", "running", or "runs", a reading system must be able to match the dictionary entry "run"; in other words, the root form "run" and its inflections "ran, running, runs" should be treated as equivalent for lookup purposes. Related to the concept of [IndexesCharterProposal#Stemming stemming] in indexes.

=====lookup=====
 A search for a user-selected term in a list of headwords, alternate headwords, and inflections. When a user initiates a glossary lookup, the reading system should search the local publication's embedded glossary, while when a user initiates a dictionary lookup, the reading system should search the user's [#preferred_resource preferred resources]. Matching glossary or dictionary entries are then displayed to the user, typically in a pop-up window.

=====meronym=====
 A relation between a part and a whole, eg, a wiki page is a meronym of a wiki; 'is-a-part-of'.

=====part-of-speech=====
 A label indicating the grammatical function of the headword (_noun_, _verb_, _adjective_, _interjection_, _transitive verb_, _reflexive verb_, etc.)

=====phrasal headword=====

=====preferred resource=====
 An available [#dictionary_resource dictionary resource] which a reading system uses during [#lookup lookup] based on a user's indicated preferences or on a reading system's internal algorithms (for example, a determination of the best available dictionary resource for a lookup based on analysis of publication metadata).

=====pronunciation=====
 One or more phonetic pronunciations given for a [#headword headword] or [#alternate_headword alternate headword].

=====register label=====
 A label indicating usage register of a [#headword headword] or [#sense sense], eg, _formal, slang, offensive_.

=====regional label=====
 A label indicating geographic range of a [#headword headword] or [#sense sense], eg, _Latin America, Western US, Australia_.

=====sense=====
 A particular meaning of a headword, and a unit for organizing information pertaining to this meaning. Sense units are typically distinguished from one another by numeric and/or alphabetic labels.

=====sense label=====
 A short phrase that restricts and clarifies the meaning of a particular [#sense sense].

=====source language=====
 The language of the term(s) which a user wishes to looks up; in bilingual dictionaries, the language of the [#headword headwords] in a section of the publication.

=====stylistic label=====
 A label identifying stylistic usage of a [#headword headword] or [#sense sense], eg, _literary_.

=====subject label=====
 A label indicating subject area of a [#headword headword] or [#sense sense], eg, _biology, architecture_.

=====synonym=====
  Terms with similar sense or meaning.

=====temporal label=====
 A label indicating current usage status of a [#headword headword] or [#sense sense], eg, _archaic_.

=====translation=====
 In a bilingual dictionary, the translation of a particular [#sense sense] of a [#source_language source language] [#headword headword] into the [#translation_language translation language].

=====translation language=====
 In bilingual dictionaries, the language in which translations are offered for [#headword headwords] in the [#source_language source language].

=====usage note=====
 A note providing detailed usage information on a headword.
