#summary Charter Proposal, Dictionaries and Glossaries

= Charter Proposal - Dictionaries and Glossaries =
*_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_*

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

== Status of this proposal ==
This is a draft charter proposal, not yet submitted to the IDPF membership for ratification.

== Need for this proposal ==
Dictionaries, glossaries, thesauri, and similar works are ubiquitous published resources that users will expect to have available in the EPUB3 ecosystem.

Publishers of EPUB3 content wish to make these resources available to users and to serve needs that cannot be met by a general monolingual dictionary typically bundled with a reading system: children need dictionaries designed for their reading level, language learners need dictionaries that translate from a foreign language to their native tongue, and users reading material in fields such as medicine and law need dictionaries covering a broad specialized vocabulary.

Reading system developers wish to utilize and innovate around these types of publications.

This proposal describes the scope, required functionality, and timeline to deliver a standard for producing EPUB3 Publications that meet the use cases that are also included in this proposal.


== Scope ==
=== In-scope (Deliverables) ===
The scope of this project is to define a declarative mechanism for the representation of [#dict dictionaries] and [#gloss glossaries] in EPUB Publications. As further detailed in [#Use_Cases Use Cases] and [#Functional_Requirements Functional Requirements] below, the delivered mechanism shall have the following top-level functional properties:
 * _ short executive summary list; "allow users to ...", "allow publishers to ..." _


=== Out of Scope ===
  * low-level, system oriented functionality for fast lookup and retrieval, typically described in terms of a database-like index.

== Timeline and Participation ==

Project participation is open to IDPF members and invited experts. _(Note that invited expert status needs to be renewed for each IDPF project.)_

This project is intended to be run concurrently with the project on [IndexesCharterProposal indexes], and so shares the following timeline with that project:

(*N.B.* dates in italics are tentative)
|| Charter Proposal Submitted to Board || 30-Nov-2011 ||
|| First WG Draft || _late January 2012_ ||
|| Second WG Draft ||  _late February 2012_ ||
|| Proposed Specification || _31-Mar-2012_ ||
|| Recommended Specification || _30-Apr-2012_ ||


== Working Group Leads ==
Suggested Leads of this working group are:
 * x _(Chair)_
 * y _(Vice Chair)_



== Use Cases ==
_ Actors: publishers, users _
 * A user opens and interacts with a dictionary publication as they would any other EPUB3 publication.
 * A user selects text in a publication and performs a lookup on that text.
 * A user searches for a term by entering text into a search field, and expects results to be offered from the dictionary publication currently being accessed.
 * A user sets a preferred resource for lookup, or sets the order in which resources are used when multiple resources are available for lookup.
 * A user sets the default level of detail returned or displayed from resource entries.
 * A user sets a default level of detail returned to a screen reader or other AT for the purposes of 'skimming'.
 * A user references a term located in a specific resource for the purposes of citation, annotation, or sharing.
 * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use embedded entries, e.g. a glossary local to publication.
 * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use a specific standalone resource, if available.

_ System: reading system, content_
 * A publication contains an embedded glossary or dictionary, and declares this resource via package metadata. 
 * A publication is standalone dictionary and declares this in package metadata.
 * A publication contains terms in multiple languages, and declares the available languages and relationships through package metadata.
 * A publication indicates that it has an intended audience, such as children of a certain age range or students in a specific grade level.
