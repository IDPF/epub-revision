#summary Charter Proposal, Dictionaries and Glossaries

= Charter Proposal - Dictionaries and Glossaries =
*_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_*

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

== Status of this proposal ==
This is a draft charter proposal, not yet submitted to the IDPF membership for ratification.

== Need for this proposal ==
Dictionaries, glossaries, thesauri, and similar works are ubiquitous published resources that users will expect to have available in the EPUB3 ecosystem.

Publishers of EPUB3 content wish to make these resources available to users and to serve needs that cannot be met by a general monolingual dictionary typically bundled with a reading system: children need dictionaries designed for their reading level, language learners need dictionaries that translate from a foreign language to their native tongue, and users reading material in fields such as medicine and law need dictionaries covering a broad specialized vocabulary.

Reading system developers wish to utilize and innovate around these types of publications.

This proposal describes the scope, required functionality, and timeline to deliver a standard for producing EPUB3 Publications that meet the use cases that are also included in this proposal.


== Scope ==
=== In-scope (Deliverables) ===
The scope of this project is to define a declarative mechanism for the representation of [#dict dictionaries] and [#Glossaries glossaries] in EPUB Publications. As further detailed in [#Use_Cases Use Cases] and [#Needed_Publication_Properties Needed Publication Properties] below, the delivered mechanism shall have the following top-level functional properties:
 * _ short executive summary list; "allow users to ...", "allow publishers to ..." _


=== Out of Scope ===
  * low-level, system oriented functionality for fast lookup and retrieval, typically described in terms of a database-like index.

== Timeline and Participation ==

Project participation is open to IDPF members and invited experts. _(Note that invited expert status needs to be renewed for each IDPF project.)_

This project is intended to be run concurrently with the project on [IndexesCharterProposal indexes], and so shares the following timeline with that project:

== Working Group Leads ==
Suggested Leads of this working group are:
 * x _(Chair)_
 * y _(Vice Chair)_



== Use Cases ==
_ Actors: publishers, users _
  * A user opens and interacts with a dictionary publication as they would any other EPUB3 publication.
  * A user selects text in a publication and performs a [#lookup lookup] on that text.
  * A user searches for a term by entering text into a search field, and expects results to be offered from the dictionary publication currently being accessed.
  * A user sets a [#preferred_resource preferred resource] for [#lookup lookup], or sets the order in which [#dictionary_resources dictionary resources] are used when multiple resources are available for lookup.
  * A user sets the default level of detail returned or displayed from [#dictionary_resource dictionary resource] entries.
  * A user sets a default level of detail returned to a screen reader or other AT for the purposes of 'skimming'.
  * A user references a term located in a specific resource for the purposes of citation, annotation, or sharing.
  * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use embedded entries, e.g. a glossary local to publication.
  * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use a specific standalone resource, if available.

_ System: reading system, content_
  * A publication contains an embedded glossary or dictionary, and declares this resource via package metadata. 
  * A publication is a standalone dictionary and declares this in package metadata.
  * A publication contains terms in one or more languages, and declares the available languages and relationships through package metadata.
  * A publication indicates that it has an intended audience, such as users within a certain age range, or students in a specific grade level.


== Needed Publication Properties ==

_ Package Metadata _
  * A publication contains an embedded [#Glossaries glossary] and declares this resource via package metadata.
  * A publication is a monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary, or thesaurus, and declares this via package metadata.
  * A publication is a bilingual dictionary and declares the languages it covers and the relationships between them via package metadata. 
    * If a bilingual dictionary publication only consists of a French-to-English translation direction (ie, a collection of entries containing French headwords with corresponding English translations), it would need to declare one relationship: French as the [#source_language source language] and English the [#translation_language translation language]. Such a publication contains one [#dictionary_resource dictionary resource]. 
    * If a bilingual dictionary publication contains both French-to-English and English-to-French translation directions (ie, both a collection of entries containing French headwords and their English translations, as well as a collection of entries containing English headwords and their French translations), then two different relationships need to be declared and distinguished in package metadata. A reading system must be able to determine that there are two [#dictionary_resource dictionary resources] present and to distinguish between them.

== Structure and Semantics ==
*N.B.*: The following terms are representative of the range of lexical and semantic qualities that will be needed to support stated use cases and also allow for innovation.

== Definitions ==

====dictionary resource====
 A collection of entries that have headwords in a particular [#source_language source language] and that a reading system can access to look up terms a user selects while reading a publication. 

====lookup====
 A search for a user-selected term in a [#preferred_resource preferred resource's] list of headwords, alternate headwords, and inflections. Matching entries are typically displayed in a pop-up window or on a separate screen.

====preferred resource====
 An available [#dictionary_resource dictionary resource] which a reading system uses during [#lookup lookup] based on a user's indicated preferences or on a reading system's internal algorithms (for example, a determination of the best available dictionary resource for a lookup based on analysis of publication metadata).

====source language====
 The language of the term(s) which a user wishes to looks up.

====translation language====
 In bilingual dictionaries, the language in which translations are offered for terms in a different [#source_language source language].
