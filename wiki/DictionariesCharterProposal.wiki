#summary Charter Proposal, Dictionaries and Glossaries

= Charter Proposal - Dictionaries and Glossaries =
*_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_*

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

== Status of this proposal ==
This is a draft charter proposal, not yet submitted to the IDPF membership for ratification.

== Need for this proposal ==
Dictionaries, glossaries, thesauri, and similar works are ubiquitous published resources that users will expect to have available in the EPUB3 ecosystem. Publishers of EPUB3 content wish to make these resources available to users. Reading system developers wish to utilize and innovate around these types of publications. This proposal describes the scope, required functionality, and timeline to deliver a standard for producing EPUB3 Publications that meet the use cases that are also included in this proposal.


== Scope ==
=== In-scope (Deliverables) ===
The scope of this project is to define a declarative mechanism for the representation of [#dict dictionaries] and [#gloss glossaries] in EPUB Publications. As further detailed in [#Use_Cases Use Cases] and [#Functional_Requirements Functional Requirements] below, the delivered mechanism shall have the following top-level functional properties:
 * _ short executive summary list; "allow users to ...", "allow publishers to ..." _


=== Out of Scope ===
  * low-level, system oriented functionality for fast lookup and retrieval, typically described in terms of a database-like index.

== Timeline and Participation ==

Project participation is open to IDPF members and invited experts. _(Note that invited expert status needs to be renewed for each IDPF project.)_

This project is intended to be run concurrently with the project on [IndexesCharterProposal indexes], and so shares the following timeline with that project:

== Working Group Leads ==
Suggested Leads of this working group are:
 * x _(Chair)_
 * y _(Vice Chair)_



== Use Cases ==
_ Actors: publishers, users _
 * A user opens and interacts with a dictionary publication as they would any other EPUB3 publication.
 * A user selects the default dictionary resource.
 * A user searches for a term entry by entering text into a search field, and expects results to be offered from the default dictionary resource, and additional resources when available.
 * A user selects text in a publication and performs a 
 * A users sets the default level of detail returned and/or displayed from resource entries.
 * A user cites an entry using CFI publication linking.
 * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use embedded entries, e.g. a glossary local to publication.
 * A publisher indicates that an EPUB3 publication should prefer to use a specific standalone resource, if available.

_ System: reading system, content_
 * A publication contains an embedded glossary or dictionary, and declares this resource via package metadata. 
 * A publication is standalone dictionary and declares this in package metadata.
