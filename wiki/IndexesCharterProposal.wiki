#summary Charter Proposal, Indexes

*_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_*

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

== Status of this proposal ==
This is a draft charter proposal, not yet submitted to the IDPF membership for ratification.

== Need for this proposal ==
Indexes are a navigational and supplemental information tool that users will expect to have available in the EPUB3 ecosystem. Publishers of EPUB3 content wish to make this data available to users, to allow them to explore book contents beyond what search results reveal. Readers use indexes in a variety of ways: to quickly locate discussions in content, to discover relevant content that is discussed with differing synonyms, to discover new terminology for concepts, and to see details of topics covered in an eBook. Indexes convey a sense of the depth of topic coverage in an eBook, break down large concepts into important subcategories, and allow exploration of content through granular and user-friendly access points. Indexes provide a human touch, a conversation with the reader.

Index information and metadata can be used by devices to provide navigation and supplemental search details to the reader. Search can be supplemented and fine-tuned by reading index metadata to provide better results. Index metadata can provide new views into the semantic underpinnings of an eBook.

This proposal describes the scope, required functionality, and timeline to deliver a standard for producing ePUB3 publications that meet the use cases included in this proposal



== Scope ==
=== In-scope (Deliverables) ===
The scope of this project is to define a declarative mechanism for the representation of indexes in EPUB Publications. As further detailed in Use Cases and Functional Requirements below, the delivered mechanism shall have the following top-level functional properties: 

 * Allow users to read or browse an index in full chapter-like format

 * Allow users to quickly access index information in a search context

 * Allow users to see semantic metadata associated with a range of text



=== Out of Scope ===
Indexes are created by a variety of tools and built-in modules in page layout and XML content management software. Details of how to implement indexing in those tools are out of scope. 

Index presentation format in chapter form can vary greatly, depending on the writer and publisher. Suggested presentation formats are out of scope.




== Timeline and Participation ==

Project participation is open to IDPF members and invited experts. _(Note that invited expert status needs to be renewed for each IDPF project.)_

This project is intended to be run concurrently with the project on [DictionariesCharterProposal dictionaries and glossaries], and so shares the following timeline with that project:

|| Charter Proposal Submitted to Board || mid-December-2011 ||
|| First WG Draft || _late January 2012_ ||

== Working Group Leads ==
Suggested Leads of this working group are:
 * David Ream (Co-Chair)_
 * Michele Combs (Co-Chair)_


== Use Cases ==
_ Actors: publishers, users _
 * User navigates to chapter-like index to browse topics and find information.

 * User clicks index hyperlinks to navigate to the book's content.

 * User opens index from book's content with text selected, triggering access to pop-up index displaying first matching main heading

 * User opens index from book's content with nothing selected, displaying top of pop-up index or last-used position in index. 

 * User browses for terms or enters search text in pop-up index display.

 * User chooses hyperlink in pop-up index display and returns to book content.

 * User can expand or collapse view of index.

 * User selects a range of text and triggers pop-up display of all in-context index entries for the range.

 * User selects in-context index entry of interest, and triggers access to popup index.
