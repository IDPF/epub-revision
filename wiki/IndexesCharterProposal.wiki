 * User highlights terms or activates text in book content to trigger access to quick pop-up index display. 

 * User searches for a term in quick pop-up index display.

 * User chooses from results shown in pop-up index display and returns to book content.

 * User sets a preferred level of depth for pop-up index display.

 * User highlights a range of text and activates semantic index popup display (what to call this??), viewing all attached index entries for the range.

 * User selects index entries of interest, and triggers access to full entry and subhead display in popup index.
