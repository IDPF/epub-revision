#summary Charter Proposal, Indexes

= Charter Proposal - Indexes =
*_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_*

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

== Status of this proposal ==
This is a draft charter proposal, not yet submitted to the IDPF membership for ratification.



== Need for this proposal ==
[IndexesCharterProposal#Index Indexes] are specialized navigational and supplemental information tools that offer readers an interaction with content that is enhanced and more sophisticated than simple search.  Users will expect to have indexes available in the EPUB3 ecosystem and accessible as easily as search. Publishers of EPUB3 content wish to make this data available to users, to allow them to explore book contents beyond what search results reveal. 

Readers use indexes in a variety of ways: to quickly locate discussions in content, to discover relevant content that is discussed with differing synonyms, to discover new terminology for concepts, and to see details of topics covered in an eBook. Indexes convey a sense of the depth of topic coverage in an eBook, break down large concepts into important subcategories, and allow exploration of content through granular and user-friendly access points. Indexes provide the added value of human analysis, enabling an interactive conversation between the reader and the book. They are also a [IndexesCharterProposal#Pre-coordinate_systems pre-coordinate search system], as opposed to search's propensity to being [IndexesCharterProposal#Post-coordinate_systems post-coordinate]. 

Index information and metadata can be used by devices to provide navigation and supplemental search details to the reader. Search can be supplemented and fine-tuned by reading index metadata to provide better results. Index metadata can provide new views into the semantic underpinnings of an eBook.

This proposal describes the scope, required functionality, and timeline to deliver a standard for producing ePUB3 publications that meet the use cases included in this proposal

As a navigation feature, support for indexes relates directly to Item 6 in the EPUB Revision Working Group Charter, regarding enhanced navigation support (see <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30/wg-charter">here</a>).

== Scope ==
=== In-scope (Deliverables) ===
The scope of this project is to define a declarative mechanism for the representation of indexes in EPUB Publications. As further detailed in [IndexesCharterProposal#Use_Cases Use Cases],  [IndexesCharterProposal#Needed_Publication_Properties Needed Publication Properties], and [IndexesCharterProposal#Reading_System_Behaviors Reading System Behaviors] below, the delivered mechanism shall have the following top-level functional properties: 

 * Allow users to read or browse an index in full chapter-like format
 * Allow users to quickly access index information in a search context
 * Allow users to see semantic metadata associated with a range of text



=== Out of Scope ===
Indexes are created by a variety of tools, ranging from built-in modules in page layout and XML content management software to dedicated index preparation software. Details of how to implement indexing in those tools are out of scope. 

Index display format in chapter form (e.g., indenting, spacing, etc.) can vary greatly, depending on the writer and publisher. Suggested presentation formats are out of scope.

Low-level, system-oriented functionality for fast lookup, reverse lookup, and retrieval, typically described in terms of a database-like file, are out of scope.


== Timeline and Participation ==

Project participation is open to IDPF members and invited experts. _(Note that invited expert status needs to be renewed for each IDPF project.)_

This project is intended to be run concurrently with the project on [DictionariesCharterProposal dictionaries and glossaries], and so shares the following timeline with that project:

 * David Ream (Co-Chair)
 * Jan Wright (Co-Chair)


== Use Cases ==

 # [IndexesCharterProposal#Chapter-like_index Chapter-like index]:
   * User navigates to chapter-like index to [IndexesCharterProposal#Browsing browse] topics and find information.
   * User expands or collapses [IndexesCharterProposal#Main_heading main headings]/[IndexesCharterProposal#Subheading subheadings].
   * User selects special symbol, prefix or suffix (for example; asterisks, dagger symbols) to display meaning of symbol.
   * User clicks index links to navigate to the book's content.
   * User clicks [IndexesCharterProposal#Cross_reference cross reference] to navigate to the target heading or to view a list of target headings.
 # [IndexesCharterProposal#Pop-up_index Pop-up index]:
   * User selects a term or phrase and triggers a pop-up view of the index displaying the first matching main heading.
   * User opens index from book's content with nothing selected, displaying top of pop-up index or last-used position in index. 
   * User browses for terms or enters search text in pop-up index display. Entering search text triggers [IndexesCharterProposal#Stemming stemming] and [IndexesCharterProposal#Auto-fill auto-fill].
   * User expands or collapses main heading/subheading [IndexesCharterProposal#Levels levels].
   * User chooses link in pop-up index display and returns to book content.
 # [IndexesCharterProposal#Reverse_index Reverse index]:
   * User selects a [IndexesCharterProposal#Range range] of text and triggers pop-up list of all in-context index entries for the range.
   * User selects in-context index entry, and triggers access to selected entry in pop-up index.
 # [IndexesCharterProposal#Standalone_index Standalone index]:
   * User opens a publication that consists of a [IndexesCharterProposal#Master_index master index], which contains links to other EPUBs.
   * User browses topics and finds information.
   * User expands or collapses [IndexesCharterProposal#Main_heading main headings]/[IndexesCharterProposal#Subheading subheadings].
   * User clicks index links to navigate to other EPUBs.

==Needed Publication Properties==

_Package metadata_
 * A publication contains one or several indexes as files or as sections, and declares these resources via package metadata. 
 * A reverse index contains the same information as the chapter-like index but sorted in [IndexesCharterProposal#Locators locator] order rather than alphabetical order. The presence of a reverse index is declared via package metadata.
 * A publication contains one or more [IndexesCharterProposal#Master_index master indexes] and declares these via package metadata.
 * An index contains [IndexesCharterProposal#A-Z_index_navigation_data A-Z index navigation data], available for use in a floating or persistent navigation feature for the chapter-like index, and declares this resource via package metadata.
 * A publication contains a machine-discoverable index-symbols list ([IndexesCharterProposal#Legend legend]), and declares this resource via package metadata.
 * A publication containing semantic markup to display lists of related main headings for [IndexesCharterProposal#Generic_cross_reference generic cross references] declares this capability via package metadata.

_Index links_
 * Index links can identify single locations, multiple locations, or ranges for lengthy subject coverage in the publication's main content.
 * [IndexesCharterProposal#A-Z_index_navigation_data A-Z index navigation data] provide links to symbol, number, or letter group breaks within an index.
 * [IndexesCharterProposal#Generic_cross_reference Generic cross references] can identify and display the related semantically-marked main headings as a list.
 * Index entries contain  [IndexesCharterProposal#Targets targets] for the navigational system's links within the index; for instance, [IndexesCharterProposal#Cross_references cross references] will have targets, as will the group breaks for letter sections. 

_Index presentation_
 * [IndexesCharterProposal#Master_index Master indexes] that index multiple volumes will include links to targets in other epubs.
 * Unique characters and numbers that act as group breaks for letter sections in the index are present, and marked in machine-discoverable form.
 * [IndexesCharterProposal#Headnotes Headnotes], if present, are marked as such and are presented at the beginning of the chapter-like index.
 * [IndexesCharterProposal#Editor's_notes,_inline In-line editor's notes], if present, are displayed in chapter-like and pop-up index.
 * Proper text alignment and indentation is maintained in the chapter-like index.
 * Special formatting of the index’s content (italics, bold, sub-, super-script, fonts, special characters) are preserved in the index’s content. 
 * [IndexesCharterProposal#Decorations Decorations], prefixes or suffixes used in the index to annotate locators (daggers, ff, n, nn and so on), if present, are marked up as such and machine-discoverable.
 * A [IndexesCharterProposal#Legend legend] containing definitions or explanations of each decoration, prefix or suffix, if available, defines the description for each symbol.

==Reading System Behaviors ==
_Note: the intent of this project is not to mandate reading system behaviors. The list below only serves the purpose of illustrating Reading System/Index interactions._

_Implied/assumed (existing functionality in EPUB readers that indexes will use)_
 * Reading system will properly display text encoded with special formatting, i.e. bold, italic, subscript, superscript.
 * Reading system must be able to discover whether an EPUB contains one or more indexes.
 * Reading system must be able to discover whether an EPUB contains one or more master indexes.
 * Reading system will properly display text encoded as a link, i.e. as clickable text that takes user to target.
 * Reading system includes buttons or menu options to access either the chapter-like index or the pop-up directly from the text, without having to visit the table of contents.
 * Reading system allows the reader to select collapsed or expanded views of the index levels (main headings only, main and subheadings, etc.).
 * Reading system determines how targeted text appears on the screen after its link has been clicked (top of screen, middle of screen, highlighted term, highlighted range of text, etc.)
 * Reading system displays a [IndexesCharterProposal#Legend legend] for special symbols used in the index’s locator decorations in a pop-up.


_<a id="chapter-like"/>Chapter-like index_
 * Reading system displays chapter-like index as normal pages.
 * Reading system displays a floating or persistent set of A to Z navigational links in the chapter-like index to allow navigation to other sections of the index.
 * Reading system displays floating or persistent access to headnotes.
 * Reading system displays breadcrumbs, if necessary.


_<a id="pop-up"/>Pop-up index_
 * Reading system displays pop-up index as separate window, automatically scrolled to the term selected when it was activated (or defaults to top of index if nothing was selected)
 * Reading system provides search functionality within popup index.
 * Reading system displays floating or persistent access to headnotes.
 * Reading system displays breadcrumbs, if necessary.


_<a id="reverse/>Reverse index_
 * Reading system must be able to uniquely identify multiple index targets in a selected section of text (e.g., a paragraph).
 * Reading system must be able to extend that identification to include index targets whose range encompasses the selected text (e.g. a range that begins prior to the selected text and ends after the selected text)
 * Reading system must be able to locate the main headings in the index associated with each of those anchors.
 * Reading system must be able to display those main headings to the user.
 * Reading system must be able to render each main heading as a live link to the heading's location in the chapter-like index.


_Standalone index_
 * Reading system must be able to link from one EPUB to another, and have a return mechanism.

== Definitions ==

=====Auto-fill=====
 Auto-fill functionality pre-scrolls a pop-up index to main headings in the index matching the letters as they are typed in by the user.
=====A-Z index navigation data=====
 A string of hyperlinked letters and/or digits (e.g., A-Z, 0-9) used to easily navigate to another section of the index: for example, clicking P would take the user to the section of the index beginning with P.
=====Browsing=====
 Reading/skimming index content.
=====Chapter-like index=====
 An index presented in a book's content as a chapter, accessed from the table of contents and from special menus or icons. It can be paged through and browsed as normal content, with hyperlinks back into the book's content, and cross-reference hyperlinks to other areas of the index.
=====Cross references=====
 Entries in an index that direct the reader from one term to another term. These should be hyperlinked to the targeted term. There are three types: [IndexesCharterProposal#See_reference See references], [IndexesCharterProposal#See_also_reference See also references], and [IndexesCharterProposal#Generic_cross_reference generic cross references (defined below).
=====Decorations=====
 Prefixes, suffixes, symbols or special formatting added to locators to indicate special content, such as tables, figures, or primary discussions.
=====Editor's notes, inline=====
 Editorial notes that are part of an index entry, found inline after the main heading or subheadings.
=====Entries=====
 A unit of an index, consisting of a main heading, zero or more subheadings, and at least one locator or see/see also reference.
=====Generic cross reference=====
 Cross references to a _category_ of entries rather than a specific entry.  For example, in a software manual: "Commands. _See names of specific commands_" Or in a book on pets: "Dogs. _See names of specific breeds, e.g. golden retriever_"
=====Headnotes=====
 Explanatory paragraph(s) at the head of the index that describe unique features of the index (e.g., special typography, scope of the index, omitted items, etc.) that the reader needs to know in order to effectively use the index.
=====Index=====
 Alphabetical list of names, subjects, etc. that appear in a document, with associated [IndexesCharterProposal#Locators locators] showing the places where they occur.
=====Legend=====
 A section of content that explains locator [IndexesCharterProposal#Decorations decorations], special symbols, or other typography for the user.
=====Levels=====
 Nested depth of subheadings beneath each main heading. A [IndexesCharterProposal#Main_heading main heading] is level 1; a [IndexesCharterProposal#Subheading subheading] is level 2; a sub-subheading is level 3; and so on.  There can be as many levels as the indexer and publisher feel necessary.
=====Locators=====
 Pointers from an entry in the index to its occurrence in the text, such as page numbers, section numbers, etc. In an EPUB, these locators should appear as hyperlinks.
=====Main heading=====
 Words, symbols, or phrases based on or selected from the book's content, expressing a concept, idea, or proper name. A main heading may or may not have [IndexesCharterProposal#Subheading subheadings], but must have one or more [IndexesCharterProposal#Locators locators] or a [IndexesCharterProposal#Cross_references cross reference].
=====Master index=====
 An index that covers more than one publication.
=====Pop-up index=====
 Index view activated by user while in the text and displayed in a separate window.
=====Post-coordinate systems=====
 System in which the user enters one or more terms which are matched character-by-character in the target text.  Search engines are an example of post-coordinate systems.
=====Pre-coordinate systems=====
 System in which co-relations (e.g., broader/narrower relations, semantic connections) between topics have been determined by human analysis, adding an enhanced level of sophistication.  An index is an example of a pre-coordinate system.
=====Range=====
 A [IndexesCharterProposal#Locators locator] that indicates a span of text, i.e. where coverage of a subject begins and ends.
=====Reverse index=====
 Index view activated when the reader highlights a range of text, which displays in a separate window the index entries associated with the range.
=====See also reference=====
 Cross reference that directs the reader to related, broader, or narrower subjects covered at other main headings.
=====See reference=====
 Cross reference that directs the user from an term not used in the index to the preferred term in the index.
=====Standalone index=====
 A publication that consists of nothing but an index to other EPUBs or external targets.
=====Stemming=====
 Stemming engines supply root forms of words and incorporate multiple versions (grow, growing, grows, growth) into search, extending the search's results.
=====Subheading=====
 Second-level, third-level, fourth-level, etc. headings subordinate to a [IndexesCharterProposal#Main_heading main heading].
=====Targets=====
 Unique id codes located in book's content, available for links to use in navigation.
