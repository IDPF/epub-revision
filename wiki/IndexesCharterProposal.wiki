#summary Charter Proposal, Indexes

*_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_*

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

== Status of this proposal ==
This is a draft charter proposal, not yet submitted to the IDPF membership for ratification.



== Need for this proposal ==
Indexes are a navigational and supplemental information tool that users will expect to have available in the EPUB3 ecosystem. Publishers of EPUB3 content wish to make this data available to users, to allow them to explore book contents beyond what search results reveal. Readers use indexes in a variety of ways: to quickly locate discussions in content, to discover relevant content that is discussed with differing synonyms, to discover new terminology for concepts, and to see details of topics covered in an eBook. Indexes convey a sense of the depth of topic coverage in an eBook, break down large concepts into important subcategories, and allow exploration of content through granular and user-friendly access points. Indexes provide a human touch, a conversation with the reader.

Index information and metadata can be used by devices to provide navigation and supplemental search details to the reader. Search can be supplemented and fine-tuned by reading index metadata to provide better results. Index metadata can provide new views into the semantic underpinnings of an eBook.

This proposal describes the scope, required functionality, and timeline to deliver a standard for producing ePUB3 publications that meet the use cases included in this proposal



== Scope ==
=== In-scope (Deliverables) ===
The scope of this project is to define a declarative mechanism for the representation of indexes in EPUB Publications. As further detailed in Use Cases and Functional Requirements below, the delivered mechanism shall have the following top-level functional properties: 

 * Allow users to read or browse an index in full chapter-like format
 * Allow users to quickly access index information in a search context
 * Allow users to see semantic metadata associated with a range of text



=== Out of Scope ===
Indexes are created by a variety of tools and built-in modules in page layout and XML content management software (e.g., InDesign, Microsoft Word, Cindex, DocBook, etc.). Details of how to implement indexing in those tools are out of scope. 

Index presentation format in chapter form (e.g., indenting, spacing, etc.) can vary greatly, depending on the writer and publisher. Suggested presentation formats are out of scope.



== Timeline and Participation ==

Project participation is open to IDPF members and invited experts. _(Note that invited expert status needs to be renewed for each IDPF project.)_

This project is intended to be run concurrently with the project on [DictionariesCharterProposal dictionaries and glossaries], and so shares the following timeline with that project:

== Working Group Leads ==
Suggested Leads of this working group are:
 * David Ream (Co-Chair)
 * Michele Combs (Co-Chair)
 * Jan Wright (Co-chair)


== Use Cases ==
_ Actors: publishers, users _
 # Chapter-like:
   * User navigates to chapter-like index to browse topics and find information.
   * User expands or collapses main entries/subentries.
   * User clicks index hyperlinks to navigate to the book's content.
 # Pop-up:
   * User opens index from book's content with text selected, triggering access to pop-up index displaying first matching main heading
   * User opens index from book's content with nothing selected, displaying top of pop-up index or last-used position in index. 
   * User browses for terms or enters search text in pop-up index display.
   * User expands or collapses main entries/subentries.
   * User chooses hyperlink in pop-up index display and returns to book content.
 # Semantic browsing
   * User selects a range of text and triggers pop-up display of all in-context index entries for the range.
   * User selects in-context index entry, and triggers access to selected entry in pop-up index.


_ System: reading system, content_
 * A publication contains a chapter-like index, and declares this resource via package metadata.
 * A publication contains an A-Z index-navigation data, consisting of hyperlinks to lettered group breaks, available for use in a floating or persistent navigation feature for the chapter-like index.
 * A publication contains a pop-up index file, and declares this resource via package metadata.
 * A pop-up index file contains anchor points for in-context index entry display, and declares this resource via package metadata


== Index Functional Support ==

_Implied/assumed (existing functionality in EPUB readers that indexes will use)_
 * EPUB reader will properly display text encoded with special formatting, i.e. bold, italic, subscript, superscript.
 * EPUB reader will properly display text encoded as a link, i.e. as clickable text that takes user to target.

_Chapter-like index_
 * EPUB reader must be able to...

_Pop-up index_
 * EPUB reader must be able to...

_Semantic browsing using index_
 * Reader must be able to uniquely identify multiple index anchors in a selected section of text (e.g., a paragraph).
 * Reader must be able to extend that identification to include index anchors whose range encompasses the selected text (e.g. a range that begins prior to the selected text and ends after the selected text)
 * Reader must be able to locate the main headings in the index associated with each of those anchors.
 * Reader must be able to display those main headings to the user.
 * Reader must be able to display each main heading to the user as a live link to the heading's location in the chapter-like index.
