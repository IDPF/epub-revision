Working list of atomic components needed to make various use cases possible.


= Atomic structural components (draft) =

 * term = alphanumeric string; should allow for formatting such as bold, italic, etc.

 * locator = need to include a method of specifying the nature of the target, i.e. whether it goes to a figure or table, so that the locator can be formatted differently if desired

 * target = need to accommodate both single-point and ranges

 * entry = wrapper for term + associated locator(s) and/or reference(s); need to allow a single entry to contain multiple locators so we don't force legacy paper books to convert long strings of locators into separate term/locator pairs, yes? <g:plusone></g:plusone> 

 * parent entry/subentry relationship = need some way to structurally represent the hierarchical relationship between a parent entry and its subentries

 * entry array = wraps a main entry and all of its associated subheadings, locators, cross references and other information

 * decoration, as a separate character or string that serves as a modifier on the locator

 * decoration, as special formatting that serves as a modifier on the locator

*Point for discussion*: semantically, both kinds of "decoration" are the same; can we accommodate them structurally with a single atomic element, or do we need two different structures? 
Same <g:plusone></g:plusone>   Different <g:plusone></g:plusone>

 * see reference = references to other indexes, e.g. “See Smith, John in title index”, are subsumed under this as being functionally the same

 * see also reference = references to other indexes, e.g. “See also Smith, John in title index” are subsumed under this as being functionally the same

 * generic cross-ref (or whatever we decide to call it) = needs to allow either plain text or a collection of links
