= SNL_R1.5_PS1 Custom Media Queries =

Additional media queries can be added for user selected states. For instance to differentiate vertical and horizontal writing modes we might have:
{{{
@media (-idpf-user-vertical-text) {
	p {margin-left: 1em}
}

@media not (-idpf-user-vertical-text) {
	p {margin-top: 1em}
}
}}}

An epub3 reading system would choose the correct styles based on the value of the user setting, while a compliant user agent (not a reading system) would choose the second set of styles based on the fallback rules for processing unknown media queries. 

Alternatively, we could use a single feature (say, "-idpf-user") with values for the various user settings.

Pros:
 # Uses an existing mechanism with known fallback behavior
 # Mixes well with other styles, has well-defined interaction with CSS
 # Extensible. We can provide any features we need, and we can craft the features so fallbacks provide reasonable results.
 
Cons:
 # It is not clear that adding our own features is considered proper (the media query spec doesn't seem to address this).
 # Adding a lot of features may be cumbersome, and it may be difficult (or impossible) to adequately list all the user features.
