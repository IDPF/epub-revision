#summary Potential solutions to SNL_R1.5

This page has potential solutions for [StylingAndLayout#SNL_R1.5_Selection_of_Styles_for_Various_User_Settings SNL_R1.5 "Selection of Styles for Various User Settings"] from the [StylingAndLayout Styling and Layout Sub-group Page].

= SNL_R1.5_PS1 Custom Media Queries =

Additional media queries can be added for user selected states. For instance to differentiate vertical and horizontal writing modes we might have:
{{{
@media (-idpf-user-vertical-text) {
	p {margin-left: 1em}
}

@media not (-idpf-user-vertical-text) {
	p {margin-top: 1em}
}
}}}

An epub3 reading system would choose the correct styles based on the value of the user setting, while a compliant user agent (not a reading system) would choose the second set of styles based on the fallback rules for processing unknown media queries. 

Alternatively, we could use a single feature (say, "-idpf-user") with values for the various user settings.

Pros:
 # Uses an existing mechanism with known fallback behavior
 # Mixes well with other styles, has well-defined interaction with CSS
 # Extensible. We can provide any features we need, and we can craft the features so fallbacks provide reasonable results.
 
Cons:
 # It is not clear that adding our own features is considered proper (the media query spec doesn't seem to address this).
 # Adding a lot of features may be cumbersome, and it may be difficult (or impossible) to adequately list all the user features.

= SNL_R1.5PS2 Specific Style Sheets =

Individual style sheets could be marked using the alternate style sheet method, discussed in more detail at http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/specs/altss-tags/ . For example, we for night mode we might have:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="nightmode.css" class="night" />

Or, for two distinct day/night mode stylesheets:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="daymode.css" class="day" title="todmode" />
<link rel="alternate" href="nightmode.css" class="night" title="todmode" />

Pros:
 # Uses existing style inclusion mechanism
 # Alternate style sheets have existed since html4
 # Consistent with similar vertical/horizontal proposal from EGLS
 
Cons:
 # Not very granular - can not be used to handle magnification
 # May confuse existing reading systems that don't understand the use of alternate style sheets
