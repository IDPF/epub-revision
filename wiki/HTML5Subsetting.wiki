= HTML5 Subset for Inclusion in EPUB3 =

== Introduction ==
The subset of the then-current HTML5 to be included in EPUB3 (more specifically, OPS 3.0) will be impacted by a number of factors:
 * To what extent are we "building up" from OPS 2.0.1
 * To what extent are we "building down" from HTML5
 * What state of completion/stability are various features/elements of HTML5
 * What namespace will be be living in (our "late binding" decision)
 * Implementation burden
 * To what extent modularization of the XML serialization of HTML5 (a la XHTML 1.1) makes sense
 * A proposed principle: to solve our problems OPS 3.0 needs to be an extended subset of the XML serialization of HTML5, with the minimum changes needed to meet our goals. _ Question: "extended subset" is a term with multiple interpretations: _
  * _ Is it a "minimal subset of HTML5" that includes all OPS 2.0.1 functionality, plus additions from HTML5 that are needed to address the new/unique requirements of the EPUB3 effort? _
  * _ Is it all of HTML5 with perhaps "very squishy" bits removed and maybe a few other removals that for some reason that we don't want? _

_ FWIW, I (Garth) am somewhat more comfortable with the first of the two above sub-bullets. _
