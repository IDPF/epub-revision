== Linking ==

_ On:Keith, Peter_

Both Peter S's [ImplementationProposalLinkingToRDFa links to RDFa-encoded reference data] and Keith F's  [LinkingImplementationProposals#PURL-based_EPUB_Identifiers PURL-based EPUB Identifiers] have been discussed. Peter S has proposed moving to an 'epub:' URI scheme instead of using HTTP URIs. Does the Working Group feel that recommending an (IANA unregistered) 'epub:' scheme in EPUB3 is a good solution?
