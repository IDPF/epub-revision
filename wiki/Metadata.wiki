== MISSION ==
This sub-group is tasked with determining the metadata features to incorporate in ePUB 2.1 and recommending best practices for their use. This should be done in collaboration with other related industry groups, such as BISG (BISAC), BIC, Editeur (ONIX), W3C (RDFa), NISO (NLM), IDEAlliance (PRISM), TEI Consortium (TEI), OASIS (!DocBook), DAISY (DTBook/NIMAS) and others.

The subgroup is addressing problem 4 in "Current Industry Problems" in the [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html Working Group charter], *plus* three issues that were raised by the ePub Maintenance Working Group:

  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/covers-metadata Covers in metadata]
  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/adding-series-metadata Adding series metadata]
  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/opf-and-onix-xml-tags OPF and ONIX XML tags]

Relevant lightning talks from the f2f:  [F2F201006Agenda#Metadata]

== REQUIREMENTS ==
[Process Requirements Guidelines]

----

=== Properties or metadata that should be embedded in an ePub ===

----

==== META_R01 Multiple Identifiers ====
_Rationale: Various participants in the supply chain use different identifiers. An ePub must be able to contain multiple identifiers._

_Dependency: This requirement is dependent on META_R??, Identifying External Models and Vocabularies._

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub._

_Use cases:_<br>
Publishers and distributors use ISBNs.<br>
ISSNs are needed for serials.<br>
ISTCs can help associate different manifestations of the same work.<br>
DOIs can provide unique and permanent access to the current rightsholder.<br>
Publishers may use proprietary ID schemes that are needed for their internal processing.<br>
Proprietary schemes may be needed when no widely used standard is available, for example to identify a particular component such as an illustration used within an ePub.

*Requirement: Accommodate multiple identifiers for a single ePub, including both standard and proprietary models.*

----


==== META_R03 Subtitles ====
_Rationale: Dublin Core as used in ePub does not allow for book subtitles. _

_Dependency: This requirement has no current dependencies. _

_Relationship: This requirement has no current relationships. _

_Use cases:_<br>
An ePub often has a subtitle. We are forced to append the subtitle to the title, but are getting complaints from publishers and the eBook supply chain about this. Series titles cause similar problems.

_Comment from (Your Name Goes Here):_<br>
(Type your comment here.)

*Requirement: Provide a metadata element for book subtitles.*

----

==== META_R07 Sorting information ====
_Rationale: With complicaed metadata elements, it is a bit hard to create appropriate/user frendly sorted lists. To aid confortable browsing in sorted lists, we need additional information only for the purpose of sorting._<br>



_Dependency: This requirement has no dependencies. _

_Relationship: This requirement has no relationships. _

_Use cases:_<br>
Harry Potter series<br>
With those 'accurate' title names, the sort result will be different from our expectation.
The first of the series is 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' (UK) And the second is 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'.
With a nomal computer algorithm, the Chamber will be located prior to the Philosopher's in a sorted list.
But our expectation is that the Philosopher's is the first.


Other use cases are available from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog#Sorting]

_Comment from (Your Name Goes Here):_<br>
(Type your comment here.)

*Requirement: Provide sorting information for each sortable element.*

----

=== Relationship to External Resources ===

----
	
==== META_R02 Enable identification and inclusion of external models and vocabularies ====
_Rationale: When metadata is based on an externally understood model or vocabulary, it expedites processing to unambiguously identify that model or vocabulary, including its revision or version number._

_Dependency: This requirement is required by META_R01, Multiple Identifiers._

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub._

_Use cases:_<br>
Subject metadata may be provided based on a variety of schemes, such as BISAC, BIC, LCSH, etc. within a single ePub.

*Requirement: Provide an unambiguous mechanism for identifying external models and vocabularies (including revision or version number) associated with a given item of metadata.*

----

==== META_R03 Enable referencing of external metadata resources ====
_Rationale: Some metadata is too large, frequently updated, or constrained to include in the EPUB itself, but should be referenced if it is available elsewhere (perhaps by URL)._


_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub.

_Use cases:_<br>
* Subject metadata may be provided by external sources.

*Requirement: Provide an unambiguous mechanism for referencing external metadata resources (perhaps including the _expected_ vocabulary).
----

==== META_R05: ONIX 3.0 ====
_Rationale:_
<ol><li>Content providers wish to enhance searchablility/discoverablility of epub content, both at the consumer (reader) and distributor (retail\wholesale\library) level.</li>
<li>Content Providers seek to maximize ROI of internal metadata maintenance efforts</li>
<li>ONIX is a widely accepted form of metadata exchange, and adoption by Content Providers is increasing annually.</li>
<li>The ability for enhanced metadata to be transmitted 'hand-in-hand' with product is desirable over the loosely-coupled file+speadsheet approach that is common in the supply chain.</li></ol>

_Dependency:_ Dependent on META_R02 for canonically including ONIX terms into OPF metadata, or establishing relationship between distinct ONIX XML file and OPF.

_Relationship:_ META_R03 Subtitles. ONIX grammar supplies subtitle information.

_Use cases:_<br>
<ul><li>Content Provider includes ONIX XML Whole or Block record file to supplement metadata elements in OPF.</li>
<li>Distributor includes, supplements, updates, or corrects ONIX XML record accompanying epub file for downstream supply chain.</li></ul>

_Requirement:_ * ONIX 3.0 Whole or Partial (Block) Record inclusion as distinct asset *


----

==== META_R06 Allow metadata content as a separate OCF resource ====
_Rationale: some types of metadata are not naturally represented as strings_

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R05

_Use cases:_<br>
Covers, thumbnails, etc.: some metadata items can be resources of its own<br>
XMP, ONIX, etc: some metadata initiatives have a structured format of its own and are more natural to be represented as files<br>

*Requirement: In OPF 2.0 metadata content is always a string. We should allow references to OCF resources as well*

====META_R07 Multiple publications for page navigation====

Rationale: Publishers may want to have their print materials be used in conjunction with their EPUB versions. They may want to reference both a hard bound version or a paperback version, which will probably have different pagination.

Dependency: This requirement is needed for navigation directly to pages.

Relationship: 
  
Use cases:

Use case 1. Publisher markets print textbooks and EPUB versions. They want the student to be able to turn to a particular page, just like the print users. The EPUB version must know what the associated print book is.

Use case 2. Publisher has both a hard copy and a paperback version that they want the EPUB to  have the page navigation coincide with. Both the hard bound and the paperback must be identified for the proper navigation to take place.

==== META_R08: PRISM 2.1 ====
_Rationale:_
<ol><li>Content providers wish to deliver serial publications, medical, technical and scientific journals, scholarly publications, educational materials, technical documentation, illustrated books, catalogs, newspapers and other rich content to the eReader channel labeled with appropriate metadata as defined by PRISM 2.1.</li>
<li>Content Providers seek to directly leverage the PRISM metadata that they already have in place for their articles and content assets when they deliver to the eReader channel</li>
</ol>

_Dependency:_ Dependent on META_R02 for canonically including PRISM metadata terms into OPF metadata, or establishing relationship between distinct PRISM XML file and OPF.


_Use cases:_<br>
<ul><li>Content Provider includes PRISM metadata elements when delivering serial publications, medical, technical and scientific journals, scholarly publications, educational materials, technical documentation, illustrated books, catalogs, newspapers and other rich content to the eReader channel.</li>
</ul>

_Requirement:_ * PRISM 2.1 metadata inclusion for serial publications, medical, technical and scientific journals, scholarly publications, educational materials, technical documentation, illustrated books, catalogs, newspapers and other rich content
