== Mission ==
This sub-group is tasked with determining the metadata features to incorporate in ePUB 2.1 and recommending best practices for their use. This should be done in collaboration with other related industry groups, such as BISG (BISAC), BIC, Editeur (ONIX), W3C (RDFa), NISO (NLM), IDEAlliance (PRISM), TEI Consortium (TEI), OASIS (!DocBook), DAISY (DTBook/NIMAS) and others.

The subgroup is addressing problem 4 in "Current Industry Problems" in the [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html Working Group charter], plus three issues that were raised by the ePub Maintenance Working Group:

  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/covers-metadata Covers in metadata]
  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/adding-series-metadata Adding series metadata]
  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/opf-and-onix-xml-tags OPF and ONIX XML tags]

Relevant lightning talks from the f2f:  [F2F201006Agenda#Metadata]

== Process ==

  * *Requirements due end of July 2010*
  * Please communicate with the subgroup using the full WG list and always begin the subject line with `[meta]`
  * Scheduled Skype call:<br>
    * Proposed weekly call Tuesdays at 16:00 UTC / 12:00 noon EDT / 9:00 am PDT / 17:00 (5:00 pm) BST

== Requirements ==
[Process Requirements Guidelines]

----

=== Properties or metadata that should be embedded in an ePub ===

----

==== META_R01 Multiple Identifiers ====
_Rationale: Various participants in the supply chain use different identifiers. An ePub must be able to contain multiple identifiers._

_Dependency: This requirement is dependent on META_R??, Identifying External Models and Vocabularies._

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub._

_Use cases:_<br>
Publishers and distributors use ISBNs.<br>
ISSNs are needed for serials.<br>
ISTCs can help associate different manifestations of the same work.<br>
DOIs can provide unique and permanent access to the current rightsholder.<br>
Publishers may use proprietary ID schemes that are needed for their internal processing.<br>
Proprietary schemes may be needed when no widely used standard is available, for example to identify a particular component such as an illustration used within an ePub.

*Requirement: Accommodate multiple identifiers for a single ePub, including both standard and proprietary models.*

----

=== Relationship to External Resources ===

----
	
==== META_R02 Enable identification of external models and vocabularies ====
_Rationale: When metadata is based on an externally understood model or vocabulary, it expedites processing to unambiguously identify that model or vocabulary, including its revision or version number._

_Dependency: This requirement is required by META_R01, Multiple Identifiers._

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub._

_Use cases:_<br>
Subject metadata may be provided based on a variety of schemes, such as BISAC, BIC, LCSH, etc. within a single ePub.

*Requirement: Provide an unambiguous mechanism for identifying external models and vocabularies (including revision or version number) associated with a given item of metadata.*
