== MISSION ==
This sub-group is tasked with determining the metadata features to incorporate in ePUB 2.1 and recommending best practices for their use. This should be done in collaboration with other related industry groups, such as BISG (BISAC), BIC, Editeur (ONIX), W3C (RDFa), NISO (NLM), IDEAlliance (PRISM), TEI Consortium (TEI), OASIS (!DocBook), DAISY (DTBook/NIMAS) and others.

The subgroup is addressing problem 4 in "Current Industry Problems" in the [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html Working Group charter], *plus* three issues that were raised by the ePub Maintenance Working Group:

  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/covers-metadata Covers in metadata]
  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/adding-series-metadata Adding series metadata]
  * [http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/opf-and-onix-xml-tags OPF and ONIX XML tags]

Relevant lightning talks from the f2f:  [F2F201006Agenda#Metadata]

== PROCESS ==

  * *Requirements due end of July 2010*
  * Please communicate with the subgroup using the full WG list and always begin the subject line with `[meta]`
  * Weekly call Tuesdays at 16:00 UTC / 12:00 noon EDT / 9:00 am PDT / 17:00 (5:00 pm) BST

== REQUIREMENTS ==
[Process Requirements Guidelines]

=== Requirements Review Status ===

_Requirements have been reviewed by:_ Alexis Wiles; George Kerscher, Daniel Hughes, add-your-name-here

----
==== META_R00 Establish the value of embedded or linked metadata ====

_Rationale: Provision of enhanced metadata should not add unnecessarily to the technical burden on developers of reading systems, publishers of ePubs or other stakeholders - where 'unnecessarily' is judged against likely use cases and the consequent benefits to the supply chain, the eventual purchaser or reader of that improved metadata. This benefit should be balanced against the technical difficulties of implementation in any reading system, and the metadata effort required from publishers._

_Dependency:_

_Relationship:_ This requirement should be borne in mind when evaluating all other requirements

_Use cases:_

*Requirement: It must be practical to meet any metadata specifications arising from the requirements below with an effort that's proportionate to the benefit of the enhanced metadata to the supply chain, the eventual purchaser or reader.*

==== META_R01 Multiple Identifiers ====
_Rationale: Various participants in the supply chain use different identifiers. An ePub must be able to contain multiple identifiers._

_Dependency: _

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R02, Potential to incorporate metadata using a variety of metadata schemes, and META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub._

_Use cases:_
<ul>
<li>Participants need to unambiguously identify the ePub, and link it to associated metadata (or to other products)</li>
<li>Book publishers and distributors use ISBNs.</li>
<li>ISSNs are needed for serials.</li>
<li>ISTCs can help associate different manifestations of the same work.</li>
<li>DOIs can provide unique and permanent access to the current rightsholder.</li>
<li>Publishers may use proprietary ID schemes that are needed for their internal processing.</li>
<li>Proprietary schemes may be needed when no widely used standard is available, for example to identify a particular component such as an illustration used within an ePub.</li>
</ul>

*Requirement: Accommodate multiple identifiers for a single ePub, including both standard and proprietary identifiers.*

The most fundamental requirement relating to metadata is the requirement for _identity_. Stakeholders must be able to identify ePubs precisely and unambiguously. There are many ISO standard, _de facto_ standard and proprietary identifiers in use by stakeholders in various parts of the publishing business (ISBN, ISSN...), but none is truly universal. So the standard must be able to accomodate multiple identifiers, with clarity on which scheme each identifier is drawn from, and how each identifier should be linked to further metadata resources either internally within the ePub package, or externally.

All identifiers would likely be optional, and multiple identifiers might be applied to the same ePub. The range of applied identifiers would constrain the range of metadata schemes that could be used (certain metadata schemes mandate certain identifiers). Ideally the set of allowable identifiers would be easily extensible.

Note that some identifiers might apply to the _whole_ ePub product, whereas others might apply to any part of the ePub (a chapter, an article...) or a resource within the ePub (a single image).

_Comment from Graham Bell, EDItEUR:_<br>
While there are several well-known and widely-applied standard identifiers that can be used at product level (ISBN, ISSN _etc_), this is not true at a chapter/article/image level. It would be difficult for the ePub revision working group to define any kind of standard for identification of granular content – must rely on proprietary solutions there. Note this does not rule out embedding useful metadata within various types of granular content files (_eg_ IPTC/XMP metadata within many types of image file).

==== META_R02 Potential to incorporate metadata using a variety of metadata schemes ====

_Rationale: Stakeholders in various sectors of the publishing industry use a variety of different metadata schemes, each applicable with a sector but none common across all sectors of publishing (books, journals, magazines, newspapers, corporate publishing...). Such schemes may be highly standardised, or proprietary. No single scheme is likely to be able to meet the needs of participants in all sectors._

_Dependency: This requirement is dependent on META_R01, Multiple identifiers._

_Relationship: _

_Use cases:_
<ul>
<li>A book publisher may wish to express metadata associated with the ePub using the ONIX metadata scheme, whereas a magazine publisher may wish to use PRISM. Each publisher is familiar with the applicable scheme, and each scheme is 'tuned' to the needs of the stakeholders within their particular sector of publishing.</li>
<li>A publisher of highly specialised content and a specific audience may wish to incorporate metadata using a proprietary scheme, perhaps a scheme that may only be utilised by a specific proprietary UA.</li>
<li>A retailer may wish to use the supplied metadata to catalogue, advertise, promote the product</li>
<li>A reader may wish to construct an academic citation to ePub content</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

*Requirement: Accomodate multiple metadata schemes for a single ePub, including both standard and proprietary schemes.*

All metadata should be structured and attributes precisely defined. As far as possible within the context of ISO standard or proprietary schemes, attributes within each scheme should be closely linked to and as granular as required by the use cases envisaged for that particular metadata scheme.

Metadata schemes should clearly distinguish between metadata that applies at _class_ level (_ie_ to all copies of a particular ePub, for example a title or author name) and at _instance_ level (_ie_ to _just this copy_ of a particular ePub, for example a usage limitation that might vary according to how the purchaser acquired that copy of the ePub). It should be clear what entity attributes describe (_eg_ whole ePub, or some part of the ePub such as a chapter or single image) - which implies the strong dependency on META_R01. It should also be understood which attributes are essentially fixed upon publication (_eg_ a title), and which are volatile and may apply only at one point in the supply chain or at one point in time (_eg_ a sales blurb). _Note there is no requirement that any particular scheme carry (or be able to carry) both class and instance metadata, or fixed and volatile metadata._

Standard schemes should be well-known and globally applicable (within the relevant publishing sector), and in reasonably common use. Schemes should be stable and have strong governance. Ideally the set of allowable metadata schemes would be easily extensible.

Metadata within each scheme should be at least as 'accessible' as the content of the ePub - if the metadata is renderable as text within the UA, it should also be suitable for rendering in Braille, synthetic audio _etc_.

_Comment from Graham Bell, EDItEUR:_<br>
It may be possible to mandate that at least some minimum class-level metadata must be supplied and incorporated into the ePub package, in _at least one_ of a very small number of widely-implemented schemes, to ensure that UAs have access to basic information that can be presented to the reader. UAs would be required to be able to utilise metadata provided in any of these mandated schemes. Candidate schemes might include DC, ONIX, PRISM, MARC. Further metadata schemes would then be optional, and might be preferred or ignored by the UA.

Identifying a set of required metadata attributes, and/or mandating a small number of metadata schemes (at least one of which would be required to carry the minimum set of attributes) would be a tricky task, as it would involve a wide range of stakeholders. The perceived minimum will vary by sector, and may involve adopting different minimum subsets for different sectors or product types (which might be expressed as separate metadata 'profiles' for books, magazines, newspapers).  There is a requirement that candidate schemes be able to communicate attributes in a rich enough way to satisfy user and UA needs (_eg_ having a required title attribute that cannot include series title, subtitle or lacks sufficient granularity to enable proper alphabetic sorting has already been established as an issue). There is an implication that all candidate schemes are able to carry the whole set of required attributes (or maybe the profiles identify a scheme _and_ a set of minimum attributes). There is a further implication that all candidate schemes be able to indicate positive absence of data (_eg_ where an author attribute was required, and the product had no identified authors).

The minimal aim of identifying a core set of required metadata attributes would be to enable precise identification and citation of content from the ePub without reference to anything external to the product itself. Any minimum set of attributes should also include a version control number to enable management of minor revisions and corrections to the ePub.

==== META_R03 Series Titles and Subtitles ====

_Rationale: Dublin Core as used in ePub does not allow for book subtitles. _

_Dependency: This requirement has no current dependencies. _

_Relationship: This requirement has no current relationships. _

_Use cases:_<br>
An ePub often has a subtitle. We are forced to append the subtitle to the title, but are getting complaints from publishers and the eBook supply chain about this. Series titles cause similar problems.

*Requirement: Provide a metadata element for book subtitles.*

_Comment from Graham Bell, EDItEUR:_<br>
ONIX and other metadata schemes provide full support for describing multi-level series titles (including 'number within series' to aid sorting - see META_R04), titles and subtitles in a structured manner.

Note also that publishers may wish to provide more informal 'collection titles' - which are like series titles and are used to collocate related works, but are not part of the formal bibliographic identity of a work (_eg_ Steig Larsen's 'Girl' trilogy)

_Comment from Takeshi, Sony Electronics:_<br>
Is there a static/written rule to distinguish Imprint or Serise for contents providers?

==== META_R04 Sorting information ====
_Rationale: With complicated metadata elements, it is a bit hard to create appropriate/user frendly sorted lists. To aid confortable browsing in sorted lists, we need additional information only for the purpose of sorting._<br>

_Dependency: This requirement has no dependencies. _

_Relationship: This requirement has no relationships. _

_Use cases:_<br>
Harry Potter series<br>
With those 'accurate' title names, the sort result will be different from our expectation.
The first of the series is 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' (UK) And the second is 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'.
With a nomal computer algorithm, the Chamber will be located prior to the Philosopher's in a sorted list.
But our expectation is that the Philosopher's is the first.


Other use cases are available from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog#Sorting]

*Requirement: Provide sorting information for each sortable element.*

_Comment from Graham Bell, EDItEUR:_<br>
As well as 'number within series', proper sorting by title also requires separation of non-sorting prefixes such as _The_ or _An_. Prefixes are language-dependent (as of course is the alphabetic order itself). Only metadata schemes (such as Onix and others) that have some structure within the 'title' attribute(s) can store this information in the form required by the UA.

Sorting by author requires separation of given and family names, so only metadata schemes that have structured 'contributor' attributes (_eg_ they mandate the inverted form of the contributor name, 'Bell, Graham', or carry given and family names in separate attributes) can store this information in the form required by the UA. Naming is complex, and publishers are particularly sensitive to the requirement of presenting names correctly, because they are highly visible to the named contributors themselves.

Note that for works with multiple contributors, order within the list of contributors is also important.

_Comment from MURATA Makoto (EGLS coordinator)

This is relevant to [http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/EGLS_requirement_list#EGLS_MM_18_Phonetics_in_OPF_metadata EGLS_MM_18 Phonetics in OPF metadata], although sorting information and phonetics might not be identical always.

==== META_R05 Enable identification and inclusion of external models and vocabularies ====
_Rationale: When metadata is based on an externally understood model or vocabulary, it expedites processing to unambiguously identify that model or vocabulary, including its revision or version number._

_Dependency: This requirement is required by META_R01, Multiple Identifiers._

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub._

_Use cases:_<br>
Subject metadata may be provided based on a variety of schemes, such as BISAC, BIC, LCSH, etc. within a single ePub.

*Requirement: Provide an unambiguous mechanism for identifying external models and vocabularies (including revision or version number) associated with a given item of metadata.*

----

==== META_R06 Enable referencing of external metadata resources ====
_Rationale: Some metadata is too large, frequently updated, or constrained to include in the EPUB itself, but should be referenced if it is available elsewhere (perhaps by URL)._


_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, Associating Metadata at a Granular Level within an ePub.

_Use cases:_<br>
1) Subject metadata may be provided by external sources.
2) Metadata that is subject to revision after publication may be provided (or updated) by external sources.

*Requirement: Provide an unambiguous mechanism for referencing external metadata resources (perhaps including the _expected_ vocabulary).

_Comment from (Alexis Wiles):_<br>
Should this requirement also detail that Reading Systems connected to the internet that can incorporate this data should, where needed, include this data when side-porting the EPUB to a non-connected Reading System?

_Comment from Graham Bell, EDItEUR:_<br>
Any references to external metadata place some obligation on the metadata provider (publisher? intermediary? retailer?) to host that metadata in 'perpetuity' (whatever that means), even while ownership of the publishing rights for that product may change, the product 'expires' and is supplanted by a later version, or the product goes 'out of print'. It may also imply a reliance on the perpetual availability of third-party external resources such as authority lists for controlled vocabularies. There are difficult version control issues here.

There could be a method to download any externally-referenced metadata and store it locally on the Reading System (_ie_ logically add it to the ePub 'package' post-purchase), and update whenever possible (_ie_ whenever a connection is available). If an external resource becomes unavailable at least the 'most recent' version would be locally-cached and permanently available to the UA.

==== META_R07 Cover Image ====
_Rationale: The lack of support for covers in metadata (defined in OPF) is problematic for reading systems and aggregators.

_

_Dependency: This requirement is (required by /dependent on) META_R??, _

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, _

_Use cases: Currently, the following solutions are implemented:_<br>
Use case 1. In Digital Editions, the cover is the first page of the first flow<br>
Use case 2. Mobipocket/Amazon use a meta@name="cover" when converting from EPUB<br>
Use case 3. In the specs, aside from setting the type to cover on a guide element (works with flows, not with images), we don't have any particular way to indicate that an image is a cover.<br>

_Comment from (Your Name Goes Here):_<br>
(Type your comment here.)

==== META_R08: Accommodate ONIX 3.0 Metadata in ePUB for books ====
_Rationale:_
<ol><li>Content providers wish to enhance searchablility/discoverablility of epub content, both at the consumer (reader) and distributor (retail\wholesale\library) level.</li>
<li>Content Providers seek to maximize ROI of internal metadata maintenance efforts</li>
<li>ONIX is a widely accepted form of metadata exchange, and adoption by Content Providers is increasing annually.</li>
<li>The ability for enhanced metadata to be transmitted 'hand-in-hand' with product is desirable over the loosely-coupled file+speadsheet approach (or ePub file + Onix file) that is common in the supply chain.</li></ol>

_Dependency:_ Dependent on META_R02 for canonically including ONIX terms into OPF metadata, or establishing relationship between distinct ONIX XML file and OPF.

_Relationship:_ META_R02 Subtitles. ONIX grammar supports subtitle information. / META_R01 Multiple IDs. ONIX grammar supports various ID schemes. / META_R04 Sorting. ONIX provides detailed Title info that can aid/provide for this granular information. / META_R15 Identification of Metadata Authority. ONIX grammar supports identifying the person/organization or agency who changed or provided the record _P.1.8 Record Source Name_. 

_Use cases:_<br>
<ul><li>Content Provider includes ONIX XML Whole or Block record file to supplement metadata elements in OPF.</li>
<li>Distributor includes, supplements, updates, or corrects ONIX XML record accompanying epub file for downstream supply chain.</li></ul>

_Requirement:_ * ONIX 3.0 Whole or Partial (Block) Record inclusion as distinct asset  AND (OR?) adopt ONIX 3.0 elements into preferred vocabulary via namespace inclusion.

*Example usage:*

ONIX 3.0 elements adopted into vocabulary of OPF metadata element as such:

{{{
<metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:opf="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xmlns:onix="http://www.editeur.org/onix/3.0/reference">
  <dc:identifier id="BookId" opf:scheme="ISBN" onix:ProductIDType="02">
    <!-- Onix ProductIDType code 02 = ISBN-10 -->
    123456789X
  </dc:identifier>

  <onix:ProductIdentifier id="otherBookID" onix:ProductIDType="15">
    <!-- code 15 = ISBN-13 -->
    9781234567897
  </onix:ProductIdentifier>

  <onix:EpubTechnicalProtection>02</onix:EpubTechnicalProtection>
  <!-- code 02 = digital watermarking -->

  <onix:Subject onix:SubjectSchemeIdentifier="10" onix:SubjectSchemeVersion="2009" onix:SubjectCode="JUV028000" onix:SubjectHeadingText="JUVENILE FICTION / Mysteries & Detective Stories" />
  <!-- code 10 = BISAC subject headings, 2009 indicates which revision of scheme -->

</metadata>
}}}

ONIX 3.0 XML file asset referenced from manifest as such:

{{{
<metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:opf="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xmlns:onix="http://www.editeur.org/onix/3.0/reference">

  <meta name="onix" content="onixFileID" />
    ...
</metadata>
}}}

{{{
<manifest>
  <item id="onixFileID" href="onixFile.xml" media-type="application/xhtml+xml" />
  ...
</manifest>
}}}


_Comment from (Alexis Wiles):_<br>

There have been conversations within the working group regarding the fluctuating nature of ONIX data and it's location within the distribution and production cycle. While it would be appropriate to provide _support_ for inclusion of an ONIX record within an EPUB package the scope of the use cases detailed here, (publishers/conversion partners updating EPUB with every ONIX change, distribution systems re-processing EPUB with every ONIX change), is not, the direction in which to head.  This type of process is much better managed through *META_R03*.

_Comment from Graham Bell, EDItEUR:_<br>
It would be best to identify some subset of 'fixed' ONIX attributes that do not change post-publication (excepting errors and corrections), and provide guidance to publishers on which attributes are most appropriate. Other 'volatile' Onix attributes might be accessible through linking to an external resource (if other requirements are accepted).

_Comment from Daniel Hughes:_<br>
I have clarified the wording of the requirement and provided examples to illustrate some of the thinking...

To address the concern that Alexis raised in her comment above, I did not intend to imply that anyone in the downstream chain would be _required_ to do anything with the ONIX that might accompany an epub. To a certain degree, metadata is manipulated by distribs/retailers already, and business rules/agreements should govern that outside of this spec.

_Comment from Graham Bell, EditEUR:_<br>
Fixed up a couple of minor issues with the examples (for example the content of some ONIX elements like ProductIDType and EpubTechnicalProtection is coded, rather than containing text, and relies on access to various codelists for interpretation). In general, EDItEUR prefers inclusion of an ONIX record as a distinct asset, rather than incorporation of a namespace.

*Volunteers to draft proposed solution*:<br>
_Graham Bell (EDItEUR)_ - I am willing to work with others to identify a subset of ONIX 3 metadata that is very unlikely to change post-publication so that it can be embedded permanently within the ePub itself, and which might provide useful metadata suitable for presentation to the user via the reading system<br>

_Dan Hughes_<br>
(Additional person who will propose a solution.)<br>

*Proposed Solution 1* _Graham Bell (EDItEUR)_<br>
ONIX 3 file asset referenced from manifest as above.

The elements that I guess are likely to be most useful -- and most stable if inserted into the ePub from two to four weeks prior to publication are:

*Proposed Solution 2* _Graham Bell (EDItEUR)_<br>
ONIX 3 data elements incorporated into OPF metadata. Selection of elements as for Solution 1 above. Note the structure of composite ONIX elements such as {{{<ProductIdentifier>}}} or {{{<Subject>}}} needs to be retained so that the full flexibility of ONIX is made available to users of the OPF metadata.

However, I'm not so sure about the details of namespacing the ONIX. Is this correct (compare with the first example above the table)?

==== META_R09: Accommodate PRISM Metadata for Serials Publications and Other Rich Content ====
_Rationale:_
<ol><li>Content providers wish to deliver serial publications, medical, technical and scientific journals, scholarly publications, educational materials, technical documentation, illustrated books, catalogs, newspapers and other rich content to the eReader channel labeled with appropriate metadata as defined by PRISM 2.1.</li>

==== META_R10 Allow metadata content as a separate OCF resource ====
_Rationale: some types of metadata are not naturally represented as strings_

_Use cases:_<br>
Covers, thumbnails, etc.: some metadata items can be resources of its own<br>
XMP, ONIX, etc: some metadata initiatives have a structured format of its own and are more natural to be represented as files<br>

====META_R11 Navigation to pages in various print editions ====

_Rationale:_ Print versions and EPUB versions may be used by the same user groups. Users of an EPUB version may want to navigate to the text found on a given page in a hard-bound version or a paperback version, which will probably have different pagination. 

_Dependency:_ This requirement is needed for navigation directly to pages. 

_Relationship:_ This requirement is related to *NAV_R04_2*. 

_Use cases:_ 

Use case 1. Publisher markets print textbooks and EPUB versions. They want the student to be able to turn to a particular page, just like the print users. The EPUB version must know what the associated print book is. 

Use case 2. Publisher has both a hard copy and a paperback version that they want the EPUB to have the page navigation coincide with. Both the hard-bound and the paperback pagination must be identified for the proper navigation to take place. 

*Requirement: Provide for association of multiple print iterations of the content with a single EPUB file by allowing multiple iterations to be referenced/detailed in the EPUB metadata.*

_Comment from (Your Name Goes Here):_
(Type your comment here.) 

_Comment from (Alexis Wiles):_
Is this issue also being addressed by the Navigation sub-group? At the F2F meeting and I think on some of the calls this topic did come up and may be under their NAV_R04_2? 

_Comment from (Alexis Wiles):_

Requirement updated 7/21/2010 per conversations in the sub-group meeting on 7/20/2010.  

As we have discussed using elements of the ONIX v3.0 spec to add metadata components to an EPUB it may be important to note that reference to multiple iterations of a print work associated with an EPUB that _also_ differentiates between the iterations (e.g. hard cover, paperback) is not currently supported in ONIX v3.0.  

The latest version of ONIX supports only the association of 'Related Product' ISBNs and the distinction that the content is an 'Epublication based on (print product)'.  ONIX v3.0 does not currently have an element within the 'Related Works' or 'Related Products' composites, both part of 'Block 5: related material' that also allows for identification of the _format_ of the Related content.  This has been addressed to EDItEUR and a request made by at least one publisher that the v3.0 spec be expanded to support. This level of granularity is supported in ONIX v2.1.

_Comment from (John Rivlin):_
The current NCX capability of EPUB supports <pageList> and <pageTarget> elements. These elements provide support for mapping paper page numbers to target locations within an EPUB. Does the NCS capability meet the needs of this requirement?

==== META_R12 Inline Medatata ====
_Rationale: PRISM allows for metadata to be encoded inline with content to facilitate navigation within an article. _

_Dependency: This requirement will be dependent on a requirement filed with the Text/Content subgroup. _

_Relationship: This requirement has no current relationships. _

_Use cases:_<br>Content providers wish to deliver serial publications, medical, technical and scientific journals, scholarly publications, educational materials, technical documentation, illustrated books, catalogs, newspapers and other rich content to the eReader channel with metadata encoded in-line with text/content as defined by PRISM

==== META_R13 Preserve offline reading and content side loading functionality ====
_Rationale: Reading systems may wish to function entirely in and offline mode with side loaded content. This implies that such a system would never be able to acquire access to metadata that was referenced from within an EPUB but not included therein. As a result, metadata references from an EPUB should be limited to optional elements so as not to preclude offline reading systems._

_Dependency: This requirement is only relevant if META_R05 is adopted._

_Relationship: This requirement implies restrictions on the implementation of META_R05._

_Use cases:_<br>
A user places an EPUB on a thumb drive and transfers it to a reading device. The reading device does not have network access. The EPUB must function properly.<br>

==== META_R14 Internationalization ====
_Rationale: ePub is an international standard and is expected to be used in a variety of language, script, character set contexts. Metadata should ideally be no more limited in this regard than the content of the ePub._

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, _

_Use cases:_
<ul>
<li>Publisher wishes to provide a title or contributor name that includes non-ASCII characters</li>
<li>Publisher wishes to provide a title or contributor name in non-Latin script (_eg_ Cyrilic, Arabic, CJKV)</li>
<li>UA needs to alpha-sort the title catalogue where titles are in multiple languages (while ignoring non-sorting prefixes applicable to each language)</li>
</ul>

*Requirement: Metadata should (as far as possible within the context of externally-defined metadata schemes) be suitable for global use in a variety of alphabets, character sets, scripts, languages*

This may not be as simple as adoption of Unicode for all metadata elements. It may require (_eg_) ability to incorporate ruby glosses within metadata, writing direction issues. And the CJKV community is not entirely happy with Unicode itself...

_Comment from Graham Bell, EDItEUR:_<br>
Note that ONIX 3 is not currently fully internationalised, but that an extension to the standard is planned early 2011 to ensure flexibility in use of language and script.

_ Comment from Markus: As for OPF-inline metadata, I think the requirement here should be to support a minimal setup of markup in metadata item values, instead of as it is today where the values are carried in attributes.

==== META_R15 Identification of Metadata Authority ====

_Rationale: Readers need confidence in the 'authenticity' of metadata_

_Dependency: This requirement is (required by /dependent on) META_R??, _

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, _

_Use cases:_
<ul>
<li>The reader notes there are two 'parallel' sets of metadata embedded or linked to the ePub, expressed in two different metadata schemes, with slight differences between them. Which is the most authoritative?</li>
<li>An intermediary wishes to 'enhance' the metadata available, but leave the original metadata provided by the publisher available and identifiable. A reader needs to know which metadata was provided by the original publisher</li>
</ul>

*Requirement: The identity of the source of any metadata should be available.*

The identity of the source for the metadata might also be subject to authentication through incorporation of a digital signature.

==== META_R16 Unique identifier must be persistent across minor revisions ====

_Rationale: Annotations and biblographic references etc. should be able to be used when pointing to different minor revisions (e.g. typos and minor corrections,   of the same publication. The unique identifier should persist so that the annotations and bibliographic references do not break when a different revision is referenced. To be clear, we are talking about the same edition, but only a minor revision. ISBN does this for example.

 NOTE: While print publications concern themselves with only the text, this requirement implies that the mechanism used for annotations and/or bibliographic references  must also not change. If this ends up being XML elements and IDs on those elements, then the IDS must not change. Because IDs are many times autogenerated, one must be careful that the revision does not introduce a new set of IDs, which would break the mechanism for annotations an bibliographic references.


_Dependency: This requirement is (required by /dependent on) META_R??, _

_Relationship: This requirement is related to META_R??, _

_Use cases: _<br>

 Use case 1. A person is selling a work which is an annotation of a publication. When the publication being referenced undergoes a minor revision, the unique identifier should remain the same so that the annotations work with the minor revision. 

 Use case 2. Bibliographic references are made to an edition, but not a revision. The bibliographic reference must work regardless of the revision.
