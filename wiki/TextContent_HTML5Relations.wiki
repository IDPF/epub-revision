#summary breakdown of solution options for establishing a relation between EPUB/OPS and HTML5

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

== Solution A: reference dated HTML5 draft ==
Produce a new OPS based on referencing a dated version of the HTML5 draft. The semantics of the HTML5 vocabulary would be "frozen" via the dated reference. OPS would define local schema/grammar(s) that describes the OPS adaption(s) of HTML5, but would defer all definitions of semantics and behaviors to the HTML5 draft.

=== Pros ===

=== Cons ===


== Solution B: compound namespaces ==
Produce a new OPS using the following principles (compare solution A):
 # elements that have no semantics beyond what CSS can capture are included in OPS in the XHTML namespace ("simple" elements)
 # elements that do have semantics beyond what CSS can capture (audio, video, canvas, forms, etc) and that are deemed to be likely to change before HTML5 becomes a REC are brought in in an OPS namespace, thereby creating a local semantic definition. This is an alternative to the "freeze" approach in solution A above. 
 # This solution may include referencing HTML4 instead of 5 for the definition of the elements in 1 above. _TBD how would the new "simple" elements in HTML5 (section, hgroup, figure, etc) be defined using this scheme?_

=== Pros ===

=== Cons ===


== Solution C: wait for REC ==
Produce an EPUB 2.1/3.0 draft, and let it stay in draft form until the W3C specs it depends on have become RECs. 

=== Pros ===

=== Cons ===
