Defined in ImplementationProposalsMetadata. Described by Bill K and Markus G.

Markus G clarifies that a decision on RDFa 1.1 has been defered.

Markus G summarizes the changes:

  * OPS gains an optional `ops:type` (or `role`, TBD) attribute globally for all elements
  * NCX gains an optional `ops:type` (or `role`, TBD) attribute on navMapglobally for all elements

This `ops:type` (or `role`) inherits semantics from DocBook `role` or TEI `type`. See ImplemenationProposalRoleOpsType for more detail. The values inside the attribute are CURIEs. This is what adds PRISM and book-specific semantics (TextContent#General_book_semantics).
