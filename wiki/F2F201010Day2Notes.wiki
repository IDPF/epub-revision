#summary Notes & decisions from the plenaries on the second day of the Oct 2010 F2F

= Decisions =

= Morning Plenary =

== Metadata and OPS Role ==

Defined in ImplementationProposalsMetadata and ImplemenationProposalRoleOpsType. Described by Bill K and Markus G.

Markus G clarifies that a decision on RDFa 1.1 and microdata has been defered.

Markus G summarizes the changes outisde of OPF:

  * OPS gains an optional `ops:type` (or `role`, TBD) attribute globally for all elements
  * NCX gains an optional `ops:type` (or `role`, TBD) attribute on navMapglobally for all elements

This `ops:type` (or `role`) inherits semantics from DocBook `role` or TEI `type`. See ImplemenationProposalRoleOpsType for more detail. The values inside the attribute are CURIEs. This is what adds PRISM and book-specific semantics ([TextContent#General_book_semantics]).

Markus G suggests that we encourage authors to follow a loose association between specific `ops:type` attribute values and OPS elements.

Rough consensus reached.

== Metadata and OPF ==

Defined in ImplementationProposalsMetadata. Described by Bill K and Markus G.

Markus G summarizes the changes for OPF, which are clarified and listed here: [ImplementationProposalsMetadata#Proposals_Summary]

Keith F wonders about whether the `link` element's attributes should be harmonized with the HTML5 `link` element. 

Keith F wonders whether the additions of the `rel` and `property` attributes to `item`s are "worth it" or whether they should just be "normal" `meta` properties. Peter S strongly encourages a single solution for referencing a cover image (among other things).

Peter S is uncomfortable deprecating (Content Conformance-wise) the DC elements outside of the required 3 (title, identifier, creator).

Rough consensus reached on ImplementationProposalsMetadata. The first draft will only use `meta` and `property`. `rel` will be dropped. DC elements will not be deprecated. 

This should conclude the initial changes to OPF.

= Afternoon Plenary =

== Text Audio Syncing ==

Defined in ImplementationProposalTextAudioSync.

Marissa D adds that she may want to add a switch based on the language of the SMIL.

Markus G asks whether this is required for Reading System Conformance. It isn't.

Markus G wonders with Bill M whether this should be a separate document.

Rough consensus reached.

== Multimedia Triggers ==

Defined in ImplementationProposalTriggers. Described by Peter S.

This is not a complete replacement for HTML5 multimedia controls but does provide a usable, if incomplete, solution. Reading Systems need a declarative way to start and stop multimedia in Non-scripted OPS3 Content. This allows a set of buttons wired to start/top a unit of multimedia (potentially SMIL too?).

We're not sure if this is significantly improved from the audio/video elements' attributes defined in HTML5. 

Adobe has already developed a similar type solution based on declarative markup for magazine interaction.

Garth C and Peter S assert that content creators find the `controls` ugly.

Daniel W is concerned the the set of `actions` is too limited (it does not include a play-starting-at). 

This is *exclusively* limited to Non-scripted OPS3 Content.

There is some concern about the absence of volume up/down and some other controls. Open tickets.

Rough consensus reached.
