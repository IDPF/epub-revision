= NCX Navigation Proposed Revision=

This proposal changes as little as possible from2.0.1

* Make Head optional and make the navMap the first item.
* remove docTitle and docAuthor
* Change the playOrder element to sequenceNumber (or get rid of it completely)
* Allow multiple navList(s) withOPS:role/type. 
* remove pageList 
* NavLists with @role of "pageStart would replace the pageList.

==Backward Compatibility==

Because the NavMap was the structure most often implemented in 2.0.1 reading systems, there should be no impact on those reading systems. If page navigation through pageList was implmented (did any reading system do this) , that functionality would be lost.
