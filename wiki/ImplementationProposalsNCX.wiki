= NCX Navigation Proposed Revision=

In order to simplify the NCX, the proposal is to write a new schema for the NCX, removing DAISY constructs that are not relevant to EPUB.  Changes would include:

  * Make `head` optional (or remove altogether)
  * Remove `smilCustomTest`
  * Remove `docTitle` and `docAuthor` elements
  * Remove `audio` element
  * Allow multiple navList(s) withOPS:role/type. 
  * remove pageList 
  * navLists with @role of "pageStart would replace the pageList.

==Backward Compatibility==

Because the navMap was the structure most often implemented in 2.0.1 reading systems, there should be no impact on those reading systems. If page navigation through pageList was implmented (did any reading system do this), that functionality would be lost.
