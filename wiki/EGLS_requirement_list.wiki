== Vertical Writing ==
=== EGLS_MM_01 Vertical Writing === 
Rationale: Japan and Taiwan heavily use "Top to Bottom - Right to
Left" vertical writing, while mainland China and Korea occasionally
use it.  The Inner Mongolia autonomous region of China uses "Top to
Bottom - Left to Right" vertical writing.

*Requirement: EPUB 2.1 should support two styles of vertical writing:
"Top to Bottom - Right to Left" (tb-rl for short) and "Top to Bottom - Left to Right" (tb-lr for short)*.
=== RGLS_MM_02 Principal Text Direction  ===
Rationale: To be supplied.
Note: I do not know how we should reformulate this requiremetn for 
"Top to Bottom - Left to Right" vertical writing

*Requirement:  It should be possible to specify "tb-rl" as the principal text
direction of an OPS document.  If the principal text direction is tb-rl, main
text in this OPS document should be in tb-rl writing mode.*
=== RGLS_MM_03 Column progression and Page progression ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement:  The principal text direction "tb-rl" should imply that columns are arranged from top to bottom and page progression is from right to left.*
=== RGLS_MM_04  ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement:  Running heads, page numbers, captions, and table entries should be in horizontal writing mode even when the principal text direction is vertical.*
=== RGLS_MM_05 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to render a document of the principal text direction "tb-rl" using the principal text direction "horizontal", and vice versa.*
=== RGLS_MM_06 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to provide stylesheets for both principal text directions. This requirement does not necessarily mean that the same stylesheet can be used for both directions. *

== Japanese and Western Mixed Text Composition ==
=== RGLS_MM_07 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to specify "one by one in inline direction"
setting style for a sequence of Latin letters or European numerals in the
"tb-rl" writing mode.  That is, each Latin letter or
European numeral should be set one by one (i.e., no rotation) in
inline direction with Japanese characters.*
=== RGLS_MM_08 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to specify "90 degrees clockwise rotation"
setting style for a sequence of Latin letters or European numerals in
the "tb-rl" writing mode writing mode.  That is, this sequence of Latin letters or a European numerals should be first arranged from left to right, and the whole string should be then rotated 90 degrees clockwise.*
=== RGLS_MM_09 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to specify "tate-chu-yoko" setting style for
a sequence of Latin letters or European numerals in  the "tb-rl" writing mode
writing mode.  That is, this sequence of Latin letters or a European
numerals should be arranged from left to right, and the whole string
should be then aligned to the center of the vertical line.*
