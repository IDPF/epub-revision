 * Bad potential interaction between required Unicode normalization and Japanese language text
	   (http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/bad-potential-interaction-between-required-unicode-normalization-and-japanese-language-text)

 * Support for page progression independent of script writing-direction
	   (http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/support-page-progression-independent-script-writing-direction)
 *  EPUB needs support for vertical directionality in writing
	   (http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/epub-needs-support-vertical-directionality-writing)

= MURATA =
== Vertical Writing ==
=== EGLS_MM_01 Vertical Writing === 
Rationale: Japan and Taiwan heavily use "Top to Bottom - Right to
Left" vertical writing, while mainland China and Korea occasionally
use it.  The Inner Mongolia autonomous region of China uses "Top to
Bottom - Left to Right" vertical writing.

*Requirement: EPUB 2.1 should support two styles of vertical writing:
"Top to Bottom - Right to Left" (tb-rl for short) and "Top to Bottom - Left to Right" (tb-lr for short)*.
=== EGLS_MM_02 Principal Text Direction  ===
Rationale: To be supplied.
Note: I do not know how we should reformulate this requiremetn for 
"Top to Bottom - Left to Right" vertical writing

*Requirement:  It should be possible to specify "tb-rl" as the principal text
direction of an OPS document.  If the principal text direction is tb-rl, main
text in this OPS document should be in tb-rl writing mode.*
=== EGLS_MM_03 Column progression and Page progression ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement:  The principal text direction "tb-rl" should imply that columns are arranged from top to bottom and page progression is from right to left.*
=== EGLS_MM_04  ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement:  Running heads, page numbers, captions, and table entries should be in horizontal writing mode even when the principal text direction is vertical.*
=== EGLS_MM_05 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to render a document of the principal text direction "tb-rl" using the principal text direction "horizontal", and vice versa.*
=== EGLS_MM_06 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to provide stylesheets for both principal text directions. This requirement does not necessarily mean that the same stylesheet can be used for both directions. *

== Japanese and Western Mixed Text Composition ==
=== EGLS_MM_07 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to specify "one by one in inline direction"
setting style for a sequence of Latin letters or European numerals in the
"tb-rl" writing mode.  That is, each Latin letter or
European numeral should be set one by one (i.e., no rotation) in
inline direction with Japanese characters.*
=== EGLS_MM_08 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to specify "90 degrees clockwise rotation"
setting style for a sequence of Latin letters or European numerals in
the "tb-rl" writing mode writing mode.  That is, this sequence of Latin letters or a European numerals should be first arranged from left to right, and the whole string should be then rotated 90 degrees clockwise.*
=== EGLS_MM_09 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to specify "tate-chu-yoko" setting style for
a sequence of Latin letters or European numerals in  the "tb-rl" writing mode
writing mode.  That is, this sequence of Latin letters or a European
numerals should be arranged from left to right, and the whole string
should be then aligned to the center of the vertical line.*

== Line Breaking Rules ==
=== EGLS_MM_10 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: A line should not begin with the characters shown below:

    * closing brackets (cl-02),
    * hyphens (cl-03),
    * dividing punctuation marks (cl-04),
    * middle dots (cl-05),
    * full stops (cl-06),
    * commas (cl-07),
    * iteration marks (cl-09),
    * a prolonged sound mark (cl-10),
    * small kana (cl-11), and
    * warichu closing brackets (cl-29)
=== EGLS_MM_11 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: A line should not end with the characters shown below:

    * opening brackets (cl-01), and
    * warichu opening brackets (cl-28)
=== EGLS_MM_12 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: A line should not be broken within the following character sequences. In other words, such sequences should be handled as one unit.

    * sequences of EM DASH characters,
    * sequences of HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS characters,
    * sequences of TWO DOT LEADER characters,
    * sequences of European numerals,
    * prefixed abbreviations (cl-12) followed by arabic or ideographic numeral characters,
    * postfixed abbreviations (cl-13) preceded by European numeral or ideographic numeral characters, and
    * group-ruby (see Clause 4)

== Ruby and Emphasis Dots ==

=== EGLS_MM_13 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to specify mono-ruby as well as fallback information.
=== EGLS_MM_14 ===
Rationale: To be supplied.

*Requirement: It should be possible to attach emphasis dots to text runs. At least two characters (SESAME DOT and BULLET) should be available as emphasis dots.

== Character set/Glyph enhancement ==
*These are not requirements to define a displayable character set.*

=== EGLS_TK_01 Unicode version ===
*Requirement: Unicode 6.0.0 (not released yet) should be supported in epub formats. We need Unicode IVS and newly added emoji symbol codes (not those glyphs), at least.*
=== EGLS_TK_02 SVG font ===
*Requirement: SVG font should be available as one of font formats for embedded fonts.*

== Page Layout ==
=== EGLS_TK_03 Binding direction ===
*Requirement: The binding direction should be selectable regardless of content layout. Reading System's UI should dynamicaly change reading direction. *
== Japanese Text Layout ==
=== EGLS_TK_04 Ruby ===
*Requirement: http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/ *

=== EGLS_TK_05 Vertical text layout ===
*Requirement: CSS3 Text Layout:writing-mode*

=== EGLS_TK_06 "Line-start prohibition rules" ===
*Requirement: No line should start with one of characters defined by contents creator. The rule must be implemented and the characters should be adjustable.*

=== EGLS_TK_07 "Line-end prohibition rules" ===
*Requirement: No line should end with one of characters defined by contents creator. The rule must be implemented and the characters should be adjustable.*
=== EGLS_TK_08 Hanging punctuation ===
*Requirement: CSS3 Text:hanging-punctuation*

=== EGLS_TK_09 Hanging punctuation rule setting ===
*Requirement: Contents creator can set hanging punctuations*

=== EGLS_TK_10 Non-breaking characters ===
*Requirement: Contents creator can adjust non-breaking characters.*
=== EGLS_TK_11 Non-separating chracters ===
*Requirement: Contents creator can adjust non-separating characters.*

=== EGLS_TK_12 Emphasis dots ===
*Requirement: CSS3 Text: text-emphasis *

=== EGLS_TK_13 "Tate-chu-yoko" ===
*Requirement: Inline block should change its layout depending on writing-mode property and an inline horizontal text block is going to be displayed within a vertical line.*

== General ==
=== EGLS_TK_14 Language inheritance ===
*Requirement: OPF must specify a primal language and it should inherit to OPS language setting.*

Rationale: Multilingual Reading system needs one primal language information to determine which font set should be applied for displaying metadata/contents as a default, especially for CJK languages.

Reading system can not rely on language settings in XHTML files.
In fact, most of ePub titles do not contain xml:lang or lang in each XHTML file.

Additionaly, since OPF allows to have multiple <dc:language>, a primal language needs to be specified to build the fallback system.

== EGLS_Voyager_01 Horizontal and Vertical writing/ Binding Direction ==

Requirement: EPUB 2.1 should support specifying writing modes and binding directions separately. The support should be considered to the following cases: 

<p><strong>Four writing modes:</strong> </p><p>1) horizontal writing "left to right - top to bottom": lr-tb  (U.S., Europe and others) </p><p>2) vertical writing "top to bottom - right to left": tb-rl (Japan, Taiwan and others) </p><p>3) horizontal writing "right to left - top to bottom": rl-tb (Arabic and others) </p><p>4) vertical writing "top to bottom - left to right": tb-lr (Inner Mongolia and others) </p><p><strong>Two binding directions:</strong> </p><p>1) left </p><p>2) right </p><p><strong>Rational:</strong> In US/Europe, binding left for lr-tb, and in Japan/Taiwan, binding right for tb-rl. In the meantime, considering global language support for multiple languages, combinations of writing mode and binding direction for other languages, binding direction shall be specified independently to any writing mode. This way, EPUB can support broader utility. 

== EGLS_Voyager_02 Ruby, Tate-chu-yoko ==
Requirement: EPUB 2.1 should support ruby by complying with W3C specifications, instead of relying on extended module. Tate-chu-yoko in Japanese, writing mode horizontal within vertical writing mode shall be supported by standard xhtml element in EPUB 2.1.

*Rational: Tate-chu-yoko can be displayed by CSS but it can be complicated.

== EGLS_CHANG_R1 ==
For any character
which is not defined in Unicode standard, or which is defined in Unicode
standard but its code point is outside of Unicode BMP can be used in the
context of any one EPUB document via EUDC support.

== EGLS_CHANG_R2 ==
For an EPUB documents which
contains EUDC, all resource files to support the display of EUDC can be
embedded inside EPUB file.

== EGLS_CHANG_R3 ==
It would be better to
provide a mechanism to assign a corresponding resource to support EUDC display
for each font using in an EPUB document.

== EGLS_CHANG_R4 ==
It would be better to
embed mapping information for all the EUDC using inside an EPUB document. When
embeds mapping information inside an EPUB documents, for EUDC that are interpreted
by Unicode standard but beyond BMP, mapping information should contain corresponding
code point such as U+20000 for each character; for EUDC that are not interpreted
by Unicode standard, mapping information should contain useful reference coding
scheme, such as TF-2121.used in Taiwan’s CNS11643 standard.

== EGLS_PS_R1 ==

The most widely used algorithm for line breaking rules in UAX#14 (Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm). It is impractical for an implementation that is targeted to work in multi-lingual requirement to add a separate algorithm for each language, especially as a single paragraph can contain parts in many languages. Line breaking rules must be described as tailorings to the standard Unicode algorithm (see section 8 in UAX#14) and neither as an ad-hoc set of rules, nor as a language-specific algorithm.
