#summary Potential solutions to SNL_R3.3

This page has potential solutions for [StylingAndLayout#SNL_R3.3_Hyphenation SNL_R3.3 "Hyphenation"] from the [StylingAndLayout Styling and Layout Sub-group Page].

= SNL_R3.3_PS1 Hyphenation =

CSS3 [http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/ CSS Text Level 3] specifies fairly complete line and word breaking.  For CJK text the "line-break" property defines where breaks can occur; for non-CJK text the "word-break" property specifies how words may be broken (including hyphenation).

CSS3 Line Breaking and Word Boundaries seems to meet all requirements of SNL_R3.3 and should be viable to address the two use cases.

The EGLS sub-group seems to have some dependance upon CSS3 Text becoming "reference-able", if that happens, we should also be able to use it for hyphenation.

Drafting note: The plan for this, as the target W3C specification is currently at the Candidate Recommendation stage is to normatively reference a non-dated version of the CSS3 Text Level 3 module (these two `specific` properties `only`), preceded by a normative note that display characteristics generated by use of these properties can not be guaranteed.

Pros:
 # Standards based (CSS3), in a fairly stable draft (Candidate Recommendation)
 # Implemented in at least one known EPUB 2.0.1 Reading System
 # Conforming 2.0 Reading Systems should ignore these properties and render the markup in a simpler fashion

Cons:
 # Not a final spec
 # Unknown implementation status (partially in current Safari)
