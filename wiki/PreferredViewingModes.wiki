#summary Additional metadata vocabularies for authors/publishers to indicate which viewing mode is appropriate for fixed layout publications such as Japanese manga

= Introduction =

It is argued that EPUB3 does not allow authors/publishers to indicate which viewing mode is appropriate for Japanese manga thus making EPUB manga authoring too expensive.  It is proposed to create some additional metadata vocabularies for authors/publishers to indicate which viewing mode is appropriate for fixed layout publications.

As in the case of the fixed layout vocabulary, no working groups need to be established for developing such additional metadata vocabularies.  The IDPF board may register vocabularies created by volunteers.
