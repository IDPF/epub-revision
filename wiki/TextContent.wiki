== Mission ==

This sub-group is tasked to update OPS for EPUB 2.1, including a new version of the preferred grammar and mechanisms for extensibility.

The subgroup is addressing problems 3, 7, 9, 10 and 12 in "Current Industry Problems" in the charter: [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html]

The list of relevant lightning talks in the f2f: 
 * [F2F201006Agenda#Semantics]
 * [F2F201006Agenda#Extensibility]


== Requirements ==
=== General ===

==== TEXT-01 The HTML browser as a rendering engine ====
*Requirement: The preferred grammar of EPUB must be designed so that an HTML browser rendering engine can be used as an EPUB rendering engine*

Rationale: the ability of EPUB to be implemented using web technologies in general (and the browser as a rendering engine in particular) is considered one of the formats main strong points.

_TBD: needs qualification - exactly what does "be used as rendering engine" mean? _
 * _ability to use browser DOM and associated APIs_ 
 * _ability to use CSS 2.1 as the styling basis_
 * _inherit behaviors (beyond styling)_
 * _... more?_

_PeterS: I think that you should be able to render EPUB chapter content reasonably well in an off-the shelf browser, but you may have to write a whole bunch of JavaScript for your webapp to support it. Note that chapter content is directly renderable in the browser in EPUB 2.0 already because of ops:switch._

=== Migration to HTML5 ===
==== Preamble ====
The move from XHTMLMOD 1.1 (as used in EPUB 2.01) towards HTML5 is outlined in the WG charter, and was discussed with a tentatively favorable outcome during the kickoff F2F. 

WG members may put forward counterproposals to the move towards HTML5. Until such counterproposals appear, the requirements listed in this section are written assuming that the HTML5 adoption is done.

As a reminder, the main points of rationale for the migration to HTML5 are: 
 * W3C is closing down the XHTMLMOD 1.1 branch of the XHTML language family, which current EPUB is using 
 * HTML5 comes with new native elements and features that are directly useful in an ebook context
 * Browser engines are being optimized for the HTML5 language (see TEXT-01)

_PeterS: I am uneasy about us jumping the gun and nailing down semantics of any element in XHTML namespace until W3C does it: we simply do not own that namespace, W3C does. We can import elements that we need in OPS namespace instead. I guess that can be viewed as a counterproposal._

==== HTML5-01 Allow for subsetting ====
*Requirement: The EPUB adaption of HTML5 must allow the expression of proper subsets vis-a-vis the W3C/WHATWG version of HTML5.*

Rationale: 
 * A grammar a.k.a "profile" that prohibits tagsoup and enforces rigid structure has substantial accessibility benefits (cf. DTBook of EPUB 2.01)
 * TBD dependency on the [RichMediaAndInteractivity] subgroup's outcomes re handling of the video element, scripts/sandboxing, et al.

_Comment: note that a strictened-up "profile" isn't necessarily exclusive; "loose" and "strict" versions could co-exist (but wouldn't have those names)._


==== HTML5-02 Allow for versioning ===
*Requirement: The EPUB adaption of HTML5 must include a versioning scheme that is controlled by EPUB*

Rationale: 
 * See HTML5-01
 * The W3C version of HTML5 will likely not be stable within the revision timeframe. *TBD* need to ascertain whether the EPUB ecosystem, especially with regards to deployment, is depending on the language being fully static. 


==== HTML5-03 Retain compatibility with XML ===
*Requirement: Documents adhering to the EPUB adaption of HTML5 must be compliant XML documents.*

Rationale: EPUB as a whole remains an XML-based framework. Allowing the HTML serialization of HTML5 in EPUB would mean that all reading systems would have to ship with two parsers; homogenizing the serialization to XML at production time seems more economical.


==== HTML5-04 Retain compatibility with the text/html mimetype ====
*Requirement: It should be possible to serve the EPUB adaption of HTML5 using the text/html mimetype without triggering quirks mode or any other error recovery mode in an HTML5-compliant browser.*

_Comment: unsure about this one. The rationale would be associated with TEXT-01; it is still unknown how browser behaviors are impacted if serving as application/xhtml+xml (or intentionally triggering quirks mode)._

_PeterS: I disagree with this. text/html is for SGML-based HTML, not for XML-based XHTML, so text/html type just should not be used for chapter content._

==== HTML5-05 Allow for inflection of domain-specific semantics ====
*Requirement: Adopt a mechanism to enable the inflection of domain-specific (books, magazines) semantics on the HTML5-based core grammar.*

Use case: A reading system with TTS capabilities implements the "skippability" behavior for notes and marginalia, e.g. allows the user to turn off the reading of note references, notes (and possibly other kinds of marginalia) during sequential TTS rendering. This behavior is only possible to implement if there are stable semantics available for noterefs, notes, author annotations, and so on. (The same principle holds also for the ability of a reading system to show/hide certain constructs visually.)

_Comment: as HTML5 has been designed to cover the markup needs of webpages, it's hardly surprising that there are some semantics missing when we use the vocabulary in a book/magazine context._

===== HTML5-05_1 Assure lexical predictability when addressing HTML5_05 =====
*Requirement: When designing the solution for HTML5-05, avoid a solution that allows ad hoc values/vocabularies*

Rationale: In order for reading systems to be able to effectively enrich their behavioral repertoire based on semantic inflections, the mechanism used must be lexically predictable and validatable.


=== Domain-specific semantics - details ===
TBD - list of initial semantics needed to cover common book/magazine constructs


=== Use of non-XHTML grammars ===
TBD
