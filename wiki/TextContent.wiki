== Mission ==

This sub-group is tasked to update OPS for EPUB 2.1, including a new version of the preferred grammar and mechanisms for extensibility.

The subgroup is addressing problems 3, 7, 9, 10 and 12 in "Current Industry Problems" in the charter: [http://www.idpf.org/idpf_groups/IDPF-EPUB-WG-Charter-4-27-2010.html]

The list of relevant lightning talks in the f2f: 
 * [F2F201006Agenda#Semantics]
 * [F2F201006Agenda#Extensibility]


== Requirements ==
=== General ===

==== TEXT-01 The HTML browser as a rendering engine ====
*Requirement: The preferred grammar of EPUB must be designed so that an HTML browser rendering engine can be used as an EPUB rendering engine*

Rationale: the ability of EPUB to be implemented using web technologies in general (and the browser as a rendering engine in particular) is considered one of the formats main strong points.

_TBD: needs qualification - exactly what does "be used as rendering engine" mean? _
 * _ability to use browser DOM and associated APIs_ 
 * _ability to use CSS 2.1 as the styling basis_
 * _inherit behaviors (beyond styling)_
 * _... more?_

_PeterS: I think that you should be able to render EPUB chapter content reasonably well in an off-the shelf browser, but you may have to write a whole bunch of JavaScript for your webapp to support it. Note that chapter content is not directly renderable in the browser in EPUB 2.0 already because of ops:switch._

=== Migration to HTML5 ===
==== Preamble ====
The move from XHTMLMOD 1.1 (as used in EPUB 2.01) towards HTML5 is outlined in the WG charter, and was discussed with a tentatively favorable outcome during the kickoff F2F. 

WG members may put forward counterproposals to the move towards HTML5. Until such counterproposals appear, the requirements listed in this section are written assuming that the HTML5 adoption is done.

As a reminder, the main points of rationale for the migration to HTML5 are: 
 * W3C is closing down the XHTMLMOD 1.1 branch of the XHTML language family, which current EPUB is using 
 * HTML5 comes with new native elements and features that are directly useful in an ebook context
 * Browser engines are being optimized for the HTML5 language (see TEXT-01)

_PeterS: I am uneasy about us jumping the gun and nailing down semantics of any element in XHTML namespace until W3C does it: we simply do not own that namespace, W3C does. We can import elements that we need in OPS namespace instead. I guess that can be viewed as a counterproposal._

_Hadrien: Agree with Peter that these are shaky grounds and using a subset or importing elements in our namespace seems less dangerous. We'll need to define a good policy regarding forward compatibility with HTML5._

==== HTML5-01 Allow for subsetting ====
*Requirement: The EPUB adaption of HTML5 must allow the expression of proper subsets vis-a-vis the W3C/WHATWG version of HTML5.*

Rationale: 
 * A grammar a.k.a "profile" that prohibits tagsoup and enforces rigid structure has substantial accessibility benefits (cf. DTBook of EPUB 2.01)
 * TBD dependency on the [RichMediaAndInteractivity] subgroup's outcomes re handling of the video element, scripts/sandboxing, et al.

_Comment: note that a strictened-up "profile" isn't necessarily exclusive; "loose" and "strict" versions could co-exist (but wouldn't have those names)._

==== HTML5-02 Allow for versioning ===
*Requirement: The EPUB adaption of HTML5 must include a versioning scheme that is controlled by EPUB*

Rationale: 
 * See HTML5-01
 * The W3C version of HTML5 will likely not be stable within the revision timeframe. *TBD* need to ascertain whether the EPUB ecosystem, especially with regards to deployment, is depending on the language being fully static. 


==== HTML5-03 Retain compatibility with XML ===
*Requirement: Documents adhering to the EPUB adaption of HTML5 must be compliant XML documents.*

Rationale: EPUB as a whole remains an XML-based framework. Allowing the HTML serialization of HTML5 in EPUB would mean that all reading systems would have to ship with two parsers; homogenizing the serialization to XML at production time seems more economical.

_Hadrien: Fully agree._

MURATA: I like XML, but will content providers listen to us?  Won't they anyway create non-XML HTML documents anyway?

_Dan Hughes: Agree. If the spec - and downstream distributor/device/software - requires valid XML, content providers will produce it. Content providers do not consider HTML/XML. They are only looking to sell product, and will adopt the specs, formats, and tools as provided by the marketplace or standards bodies._

_Liza Daly_: It is totally the case that all ereader software consumes HTML, not just XHTML. 

==== HTML5-04 Retain compatibility with the text/html mimetype ====
*Requirement: It should be possible to serve the EPUB adaption of HTML5 using the text/html mimetype without triggering quirks mode or any other error recovery mode in an HTML5-compliant browser.*

_Comment: unsure about this one. The rationale would be associated with TEXT-01; it is still unknown how browser behaviors are impacted if serving as application/xhtml+xml (or intentionally triggering quirks mode)._

_PeterS: I disagree with this. text/html is for SGML-based HTML, not for XML-based XHTML, so text/html type just should not be used for chapter content._

_Hadrien: If we enforce XML, we need to use application/xhtml+xml not text/html._

_Markus: (@PeterS and Hadrien) Note that the underlying hint here is that *if* (and only if) it is deemed crucial to browser compatibility to be able to define documents that are servable as text/html, then the [http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-xhtml-author-guide/html-xhtml-authoring-guide.html polyglot] syntax would be used. The intent of the polyglot spec is to be a syntactical bridge between these two media types.

==== HTML5-05 Allow for inflection of domain-specific semantics ====
*Requirement: Adopt a mechanism to enable the inflection of domain-specific (books, magazines) semantics on the HTML5-based core grammar.*

Use case: A reading system with TTS capabilities implements the "skippability" behavior for notes and marginalia, e.g. allows the user to turn off the reading of note references, notes (and possibly other kinds of marginalia) during sequential TTS rendering. This behavior is only possible to implement if there are stable semantics available for noterefs, notes, author annotations, and so on. (The same principle holds also for the ability of a reading system to show/hide certain constructs visually.)

_Comment: as HTML5 has been designed to cover the markup needs of webpages, it's hardly surprising that there are some semantics missing when we use the vocabulary in a book/magazine context._

===== HTML5-05_1 Assure lexical predictability when addressing HTML5_05 =====
*Requirement: When designing the solution for HTML5-05, avoid a solution that allows ad hoc values/vocabularies*

Rationale: In order for reading systems to be able to effectively enrich their behavioral repertoire based on semantic inflections, the mechanism used must be lexically predictable and validatable.


=== Domain-specific semantics - details ===

==== General book semantics ====

===== BOOK-NOTES notes and note references ====
* Requirement: the OPS vocabulary must allow unambiguous specification of _notes_ and _note references_ *

Notes provide or reference sources of additional information or acknowledge the source of a quotation or idea. Each note is typically referenced by a noteref or prefixed by a page location where explicit references have been omitted from the text.

Notes in printed matter are generally distinguishable from annotations by their location either at the bottom of print pages, at the end of sections or in the back matter of a document. Annotations typically occur in the margin near the text being annotated.

Note references typically appear as superscripted numbers or symbols within the narrative flow.

===== BOOK-ANNOTATIONS annotations and annotation references ====
* Requirement: the OPS vocabulary must allow unambiguous specification of _annotations_ and _annotation references_ *

Note: this requirement relates to _static content annotations_, such that are present in the original publication (as added by authors, translators, etc).

===== BOOK-ASIDE-NATURE nature of asides =====
* Requirement: the OPS vocabulary must allow the expression of refined semantics of _aside_s *

Rationale: some asides/sidebars are optional in nature (are set aside to signal that the reader can safely skip them), others are crucial (are set aside to stand out from the base narrative flow (warnings and so on)). To support skippability during dynamic TTS and or synced audio rendering, it must be possible for content to maintain this distinction.

===== BOOK-BRIDGEHEAD non-structural headings =====
* Requirement: the OPS vocabulary must allow the unambiguous specification of non-structural headings *

Rationale: in text books in particular, constructs such as tables, lists and figures sometimes contain headings that do not impact the overall sectioning structure of the content. It must be possible to distinguish these from proper structural section headings, for AT use, and to maintain NCX autogeneration capabilities.

Compare: Docbook _bridgehead_, DTBook _bridgehead_ and DTBook _hd_.

===== BOOK-PAGINATION maintain location of pagebreaks=====
* Requirement: the OPS vocabulary must allow the unambiguous specification of the location of page breaks (as they appear in a paper print source being replicated as EPUB) *

Rationale: even though in general it is better (in a reflowable context) to maintain this information in the NCX alone, the ability to inline this information (at least during authoring stages) is useful when autogenerating NCX from the OPS content. Further, the ability to turn off the announcement of page breaks, when present in content, is a typical use of the skippability feature.
  
==== BOOK-FIGUREDESC-MARKUP figure descriptions with markup ====
* Requirement: the OPS vocabulary must allow figure descriptions to be provided that contain rich markup *

Rationale: when providing descriptions of rich figures, _@alt_ is insufficient. Further, it is generally bad from an i18n perspective to provide information intended for human consumption in attribute values.

==== BOOK-FIGUREDESC-EXTERNAL external figure descriptions ====
* Requirement: the OPS vocabulary must allow figure descriptions to be provided out-of-line with unambiguous linking semantics *

Rationale: TBD George


==== Dictionaries/glossaries ====


==== Magazine/Article semantics ====
TBD

=== Support Bibliographic Citations===

_comment: This is also in the navigation requriements, hense using the same requirement number as in navigation._

==== NAV_06 Reading System must provide Bibliographic reference to user====

 * Requirement:  Reading System must provide to the user a correct bibliographic reference that can be used to site the current location in the EPUB document.
Use case: Students using EPUB can use their reading system to tell them the current location that can be used in writing formal papers. 

==== NAV_07 Reading System must Navigate to location based on Bibliographic Reference====

 * Requirement: Reading System must provide the ability for a user to go to a location in a EPUB document based on a correct bibliographic reference.

Use case: User is reading a formal paper and wants to check the reference in the publication.


=== ePub Extensibility ===

==== TEXT-02 OCF Extensibility ====
*Requirement: ePub2.1/3.0 should keep OCF extensibility described in ePub2.0.*

Rationale:  Current OCF extensibility is used for Sony's periodical titles.
 Multiple root files:
  In OCF, it allows to set multiple root files. Sony's periodical titles specifiy OPS and Atom file as root file. The Atom file contains semantics information for each article/section page and it helps article/section navigation.

 Metadata:
  In OCF, metadata.xml itself is reserved. Since our periodical titles contain two types of root content, metadata for the package is described in the file.


==== TEXT-03 A root file for semantics ===
*Requirement: container.xml can specify a semantic information file as one of root files.*

Rationale: Sony's periodical titles specifiy OPS and Atom file as root file. The Atom file contains semantics information for each article/section page and it helps article/section navigation.

_Use case 1: Access across the media _
  Each article should be recognized as one of digital articles, regardless of ePub or Web.

_Use case 2: Semantic information for navigation _
  Sometimes, user encounter a long article. In print version, it is easy to distinguish a long article, but in ePub Reading system, it is a bit hard.
  To skip to other place, buttons which navigate to the section top page and next/previous article/section page are required as a part of UI.  Such semantic information, or relations,  needs to be written in a file.
