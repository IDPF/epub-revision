#summary Collect and document changes to metadata grammar as developed in solution proposals.

This page is a work-in-progress to collect and document changes to metadata grammar as they develop from solution proposals. Documenting changes to existing elements, and addition of new elements or attributes, should encourage reuse of proposed changes, and help keep metadata grammar/vocabulary consistent and compact.
