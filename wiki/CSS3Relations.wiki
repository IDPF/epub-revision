= Introduction =

This page shows possible options for adopting or not adopting CSS3, which 
is still under development.  None of the features required for 
EGLS have reached the candidate recommendation status.

= Options =

== Solution A: Wait for CSS3 ==

We wait until CSS3 is finished. Don't adopt unfinished CSS3 features.

*Pros:*

*Cons:*

== Solution B: Introduce experimental CSS3 properties with our own prefix ==

We adopt CSS3 properties in working drafts (i.e., not-yet candidate recommendations) with a prefix (e.g. -idpf-writing-mode, -idpf-text-emphasis).

*Pros:*

*Cons:*

== Solution C: Introduce EPUB specific properties ==

We invent our own properties without waiting for CSS3.

*Pros:*

*Cons:*
== Solution D: Introduce non-CSS style information ==

We use style specification other than CSS3. 
=== D1: Non-CSS stylesheet languages ===
Use other stylesheet languages such as XSL-FO or our own.

=== D2: Style information in OPF packages ===
Add style info (especially, horizontal/vertical text direction) in OPF package document.
 * Add 'text-direction' and 'page-progression-direction' attributes in OPF

=== D3: EPUB specific HTML classes ===
Introduce EPUB specific HTML class names and define their styles rather than using CSS3 properties.
 * Define class names for emphasis marks
