= Introduction =

In preparation to the [TaipeiFixedLayoutWorkshop IDPF EPUB Workshop for Fixed Layout in Taipei on 2011-10-25],taxonomy of mechanisms for fixed layout is presented. It is hoped that this taxonomy allow IDPF to understand existing or upcoming mechanisms for fixed layout and compare different proposals.

Feedbacks to this taxonomy are very wellcome.

= 1. Mechanisms for specifying fixed layout =

 * HTML and CSS relative or absolute positioning (e.g., [BooksFixedLayout])
 * SVG containing images and text
 * Bitmap images (e.g., JPEG and PNG)
 * JSON or other custom data format packaged with JS renderer 
  # PDF and renderers such as [https://github.com/andreasgal/pdf.js/ PDF.js]
  # [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation Portable Game Notation (Chess)] and its renders in Javascript
  # [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format Smart Game Format (mainly for Go)]and its renders in Javascript

= 2. Mechanisms for announcing fixed layoutness =

 * Properties in EPUB package documents (e.g., [SonyFixedLayoutFormat])
 * Meta elements of HTML5 documents  (e.g., [iBooksFixedLayout])
 * Files of particular names in EPUB3 publications (e.g., [BNFixedFormat])

= 3. Mechanisms for selecting a particular fixed layout from a collection of fixed or reflow layouts =

 * CSS media queries
 * Multiple package documents per OCF Container 

= 4. Granularity =

 * A single XHTML/SVG/image file per page (e.g., [iBooksFixedLayout])
 * A single XHTML/SVG/image file per two-page spread
 * A single XHTML/SVG/image file for a collection of pages

= 5. Specialized user interfaces =

Apart from the normal operations for page transition, there are additional operations for fixed layout.

 * Automatic panning and zooming
 * Region-based links to internal or external documents

These operations require region data on top of fixed layout.
