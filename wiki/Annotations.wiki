#summary The EPub vNext Annotations sub-group page

= Annotations - 'metadata on content' =

<wiki:toc max_depth="5" />

== Mission ==

The goal of the annotations sub-group is to provide a specification for schema and storage of data associated with content in an EPUB document. It is quite likely that the specification will be an entirely separate document (e.g. not unlike OPS, OCF, OPF) under the EPUB umbrella. (Needs refinement.)

== Scenarios ==

This section should have scenarios that describe the creation and use of metadata/annotations. It is not a requirement that the final specification covers every scenario. It should not go into technical details about implementation issues (more detail needed):
  *	Author’s annotations – ancillary content included at content packaging/publication time, these may be included in the EPUB (shared)
    #	Last minute errata
    #	Pronunciation
    #	Footnote
    #	Commentary
  *	Reader’s annotations – annotations and bookmarks developed by a single reader (may or may not be shared)
    #	Underlining/highlighting significant content (text, images, tables, video, etc.)
    #	Adding a bookmark (perhaps automatically by the reading system for the farthest position read)
    #	Adding a comment (textual note) to a range of selected content (text, image, video).
    #	Mindless drawing/doodles
    #	Adding an image to a range of selected content
    #	Adding an audio or video recording to a range of selected content
    #   Create a linkage between a point in a document and any other resource
  *	Published annotations – may be part of a commercial offering or an explicit group context (shared)
    #   All of the above
    #	Answers to a quiz (rich media) meant for teacher.
    #	Notes from a teacher to students.
    #	Notes from myself to members of my book club.
    #	Adding a table containing additional experimental data to an existing table in a scholarly journal.
    #	Annotations from a third party for sale to students reading Huckleberry Finn.
    #   Errata
    #	“Definitive” commentary from an interesting voice (editor, celebrity, historical player, etc).
    #   Annotations on annotations

== Requirements ==

==== ANNOT_R1 Mechanism to guarantee that document content has not changed ====

_Rationale: The scenario we need to prevent here is  - an author creates a document and says “Vinay is a good guy”, I come along and add an annotation that says “I agree” (that Vinay is a good guy), the author later edits the document to read “Vinay is a criminal”, my “I agree” annotation will now be misinterpreted by subsequent viewers of my annotation.
