#summary The EPub vNext Annotations sub-group page

= Annotations - 'metadata on content' =

== Mission ==

The goal of the annotations sub-group is to provide a specification for schema and storage of data associated with content in an EPUB document. It is quite likely that the specification will be an entirely separate document (e.g. not unlike OPS, OCF, OPF) under the EPUB umbrella. (Needs refinement.)

== Scenarios ==

This section should have scenarios that describe the creation and use of metadata/annotations. It is not a requirement that the final specification covers every scenario. It should not go into technical details about implementation issues (more detail needed):
  *	Author’s annotations – ancillary content included at content packaging/publication time, these may be included in the EPUB (shared)
    #	Last minute errata
    #	Pronunciation
    #	Footnote
    #	Commentary
  *	Reader’s annotations – annotations and bookmarks developed by a single reader (may or may not be shared)
    #	Underlining/highlighting significant text
    #	Adding a bookmark (perhaps automatically by the reading system for the farthest position)
    #	Adding a comment (textual note) to a range of selected text.
    #	Mindless drawing/doodles
    #	Adding an image to a range of selected text
    #	Adding an audio or video recording to a range of selected text
  *	Published annotations – may be part of a commercial offering or an explicit group context (shared)
    #	Answers to a quiz (rich media) meant for teacher.
    #	Notes from a teacher to students.
    #	Notes from myself to members of my book club.
    #	Adding a table containing additional experimental data to an existing table in a scholarly journal.
    #	Annotations from a third party for sale to students reading Huckleberry Finn.
    #   Errata
    #	“Definitive” commentary from an interesting voice (editor, celebrity, historical player, etc).
