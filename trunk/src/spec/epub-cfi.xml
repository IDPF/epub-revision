            <title>Purpose and Scope</title>

            <para xml:id="sibling-specs">This specification, EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifier
                (epubcfi), defines a standardized method for referencing arbitrary content within an
                    <link linkend="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB® 3 Publication</link> through the
                use of fragment identifiers. </para>

            <para>The Web has proven that the concept of hyperlinking is tremendously powerful, but
                EPUB Publications have been denied much of the benefit that hyperlinking makes
                possible because of the lack of a standardized scheme to link into them. Although
                proprietary schemes have been developed and implemented for individual <xref
                    linkend="gloss-epub-reading-system"/>s, without a commonly-understood syntax
                there has been no way to achieve cross-platform interoperability. The functionality
                that can see significant benefit from breaking down this barrier, however, is
                varied: from reading location maintenance to annotation attachment to navigation,
                the ability to point into any Publication opens a whole new dimension not previously
                available to developers and <xref linkend="gloss-author"/>s. </para>

            <para>This specification attempts to rectify this situation by defining an arbitrary
                structural reference that can uniquely identify any location, or simple range of
                locations, in a Publication: the EPUB CFI. The following considerations have
                strongly influenced the design and scope of this scheme:</para>

                    <para>The mechanism used to reference content should be interoperable:

                        usable by another.</para>

            <para>A fragment identifier is the part of a URI that defines a location within a
                resource. Syntactically, it is the segment attached to the of end the resource URI
                starting with a hash (<literal>#</literal>). For HTML documents, IDs and named
                anchors are used as fragment identifiers, while for XML documents the Shorthand
                XPointer <xref linkend="refXPTRSH"/> notation is used to refer to a given ID.</para>

            <para>A Canonical Fragment Identifier (CFI) is a similar construct to these, but
                expresses a location within an EPUB Publication. For example:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis>demo.epub#epubcfi(/6/4[chap01ref]!/4[body01]/10[para05]/3:10)</synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>The function-like string immediately following the hash
                    (<literal>epubcfi(…)</literal>) indicates that this fragment identifier conforms
                to the scheme defined by this specification, and the value contained in the
                parentheses is the syntax used to reference the location within the
                specified Publication (<filename>demo.epub</filename>). Using the processing rules
                defined in <xref linkend="sec-path-res"/>, any Reading System can parse this syntax,
                open the corresponding Content Document in the Publication and load the specified
                location for a <xref linkend="gloss-user"/>.</para>

            <para>A complete definition of the EPUB CFI syntax is provided in the next
                section.</para>

            <note>
                <para><literal>epub</literal> has been prepended to the name of the scheme as a more
                    generic CFI-like scheme may be defined in the future for all XML+ZIP-based file
                    formats.</para>

            <para>A Canonical Fragment Identifier (CFI) consists of an initial sequence
                    <literal>epubcfi</literal> that identifies this particular reference method, and
                a parenthesized path or range. A path is built up as a sequence of structural steps
                to reference a location. A range is a path followed by two local (or relative) paths
                that identify the start and end of the range.</para>

            <para>Steps can either be navigational or terminating. Navigational steps may be
                repeated as necessary (to count elements, to process children, or to follow
                references). There may be only one terminating step, which, if present, must be the
                last step in the sequence. </para>

            <para>Substrings in brackets are extensible assertions that improve the robustness of
                traversing paths and migrating them from one revision of the document to another.
                These assertions preserve additional information about traversed elements of the
                document, which makes it possible to recover intended location even after some
                modifications are made to the Publication.</para>

            <para>The <literal>value</literal> definition in the syntax above can either be a quoted
                string (delimited by quote characters (<literal>"</literal>)) or a sequence of
                characters. The following characters can only appear in a quoted string, as they
                would otherwise interfere with parsing:</para>

                    Content Document (for XHTML content, the reference would be to the

                <para>A terminating step with a leading colon (<literal>:</literal>) followed by an
                    integer refers to a character offset. For element nodes, the character offset is
                    a UTF-16 codepoint index in the element's intrinsic textual value. This value is
                    zero for most element nodes, except for the XHTML <code>img</code> element where
                    the <code>alt</code> attribute value is used. For text nodes, or a collection of
                    nodes, the UTF-16 codepoint index is calculated after concatenating text data
                    from all the nodes. The offset is zero-based and always refers to a position
                    between characters, so <literal>0</literal> means before the first character and
                    a number equal to the total UTF-16 length means after the last character. A
                    character offset value greater than the UTF-16 length of the available text must
                    not be specified.</para>

                <para>A character offset terminating step may only be present following a

                the same Publication, the following rules must be applied:</para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>the "URI un-escaped" core path is used;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>all bracketed annotations are removed or ignored entirely;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>steps that come earlier in the sequence are more important;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>XML child nodes, character offsets and temporal positions are sorted in
                        natural order;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>the <literal>y</literal> position is more important than
                            <literal>x</literal>;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>omitted spatial position precedes all other spatial positions;</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>omitted temporal position precedes all other temporal positions;</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>different step types come in the following order from least important to
                        most important: character offset (<literal>:</literal>), child
                            (<literal>/</literal>), temporal-spatial (<literal>~</literal> or
                            <literal>@</literal>), reference/indirect (<literal>!</literal>).</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-relative-cfis">
            <title>Relative CFIs</title>

            <para>A CFI can also be used to cross-reference XML content inside the <xref
                    linkend="gloss-container"/>. This kind of referencing can be achieved by
                specifying a reference to a particular resource in the <xref linkend="gloss-spine"/>
                followed by a CFI which must be resolved starting from the document root
                element.</para>

            <para>For example, using the OPF file in the <link linkend="sec-path-examples">previous 
                example</link>, a reference to the last location in <filename>chapter02.xhtml</filename> 
                might be written as follows:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis><![CDATA[<a href="chapter01.xhtml#epubcfi(/4[body01]/10[para05]/2/1:3b)">location</a>]]></synopsis>
            </informalexample>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-ranges">
            <title>Simple Ranges</title>

            <para>EPUB CFIs allow the expression of simple ranges extending from a start location to
                an end location. A range must be expressed as a triple of
                    <emphasis>parent</emphasis> path (<literal>P</literal>),
                    <emphasis>start</emphasis> subpath (<literal>S</literal>) and
                    <emphasis>end</emphasis> subpath (<literal>E</literal>), or of the form:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis>#epubcfi(P,S,E)</synopsis>
            </informalexample>
            
            <para>The parent path must end at a step that is common for resolving both the path of the 
                start and end locations of the range, and each start and end subpath must resolve to
                a location in non-decreasing order in the document.</para>
            
            <para>To determine the start and end locations of the range, the start and end subpaths
                must be concatenated to the parent path to create the start location path 
                (<literal>PS</literal>) and end location path (<literal>PE</literal>).</para>

            <para>Using the <link linkend="sec-path-examples">sample document above</link>, the 
                following range would represents the text from the second
                    <literal>b</literal> in <literal>bbb</literal> up to (and including) digit
                    <literal>3</literal>:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis>epubcfi(/6/4[chap01ref]!/4[body01]/10[para05],/2/1:1,/3:4)</synopsis>
            </informalexample>
            
            <para>Ranges must be compared according to their <literal>PS</literal>, then 
                <literal>PE</literal>, components.</para>

            <para>It is not valid to use a path to an element as a shorthand for the range
                from the beginning to the end of the element. Single path notation always denotes a
                location point, and range is represented by the notation described above. There is no
                special step to produce a reference to the end of an element, as that would make
                sorting impossible without consulting the content of the document.</para>

            <para>If range is used where single location is expected by the context, the start
                location must be used.</para>
            
            <para>Side-bias parameters must not be used for ranges; the start of a range is
                implicitly attached to the content after the start location and the end is implicitly
                attached to the content before the end location.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-target-correction">
            <title>Intended Target Location Correction</title>

            <para>As an EPUB Publication may be updated, corrected or otherwise altered over time, it is 
                useful to be able to derive an EPUB CFI for the modified document from one that 
                targeted a previous version. This specification provides two mechanisms to detect and 
                adapt to content changes that impact CFIs: IDs <xref linkend="refXML"/> and 
                <link linkend="sec-path-text-location">text location assertions</link>.</para>
            
            <para>When a Reading System is processing a CFI, it should check the correctness of any
                encountered assertions. For example, given the path <literal>/6/4[chap01ref]!...</literal>,
                the Reading System should verify that the element has the ID matching <literal>chap01ref</literal>
                when processing element <literal>4</literal> (for this example, an <code>itemref</code> in the
                <code>spine</code>). If not, the Reading System should locate the ID <literal>chap01ref</literal> 
                within the document and correct the CFI (e.g. if a new <code>itemref</code> was inserted before the
                    <literal>chap01ref</literal> <code>itemref</code>, the desired element number would now 
                be <literal>6</literal> and the corrected CFI would be <literal>/6/6[chap01ref]!...</literal>). 
                Likewise, text location assertions should be used to check referenced target locations, and used 
                to derive a corrected CFI that targets the desired text location.</para>

            <para>If one of the assertions fails during processing, and a corrected CFI can not be
                derived (the ID is not found in the document, or text matches could not be found), the
                CFI must be considered an invalid reference. In cases where a Reading System cannot
                check for correctness (e.g. document-resident XML IDs are not available at CFI
                processing time), a Reading System must ignore the CFI assertions.</para>

            <para>This notion of correcting CFIs can lead to circumstances where two different
                CFIs point to the same location (i.e. the "stale" CFI, pre-correction, and the
                corrected CFI). The corrected CFI should be used where possible. A Reading System
                and any surrounding content management system should attempt to replace stale CFIs
                with their corrected versions where possible.</para>
            
            <note>
                <para>This specification encourages the development of custom functions to assist with
                    CFI correction where the intrinsic functionality is insufficient. Refer to 
                    <xref linkend="sec-extensions"/> for more information on how to develop such functionality.</para>

        <title>Extending EPUB CFIs</title>

        <para>The provision for extensions (CSV parameter lists, prefixed by a parameter name, 
            and separated by semicolons) allow Reading Systems to apply new or experimental heuristics 
            to assist, for example, in migrating EPUB CFI fragments to updated documents.</para>
        
        <para>It is recommended that any vendor-specific parameter names start with
            <literal>vnd.</literal> followed by the vendor name.</para>
