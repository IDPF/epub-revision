		<title>Introduction</title>

		<para>EPUBÂ® is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and
			Web Standards. An EPUB Publication can be thought of as a reliable packaging of Web content
			that represents a digital book, magazine, or other type of publication, and that can be
			distributed for online and offline consumption. </para>

		<para>This document, EPUB 3.0.1 Changes from EPUB 3.0, describes changes made in the first
			minor revision of the EPUB 3.0 specifications, highlighting key changes and
			additions.</para>

		<para>This document is non-normative. Consult the EPUB specification documents for definitive
			information on EPUB 3:</para>

			<title>EPUB Revision History</title>

			<para>EPUB had its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication
				Structure (OEBPS). OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an
				organization that later became the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).
				Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the IDPF in 2001 and 2002
				respectively.</para>

			<para> It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for
				delivery as well as interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container
				format for OEPBS, which was approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in
				2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS began in parallel which was approved as the
				renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007, consisting of a triumvirate of specifications: Open
				Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF) together with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a
				maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set primarily intended clarify and correct
				errata in the specifications, was approved in September, 2010. <xref linkend="refOPF2"/>
				<xref linkend="refOPS2"/>
				<xref linkend="refOCF2"/></para>

			<para>Work on a major new 3.0 revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the
				goal of aligning EPUB more closely with HTML5, and in the process bringing new, native
				multimedia features, sophisticated CSS layout rendering and font embedding, scripted
				interactivity, enhanced global language support, and improved accessibility. A new
				specification, EPUB Media Overlays was also introduced, enabling text and audio
				synchronization in EPUB Publications. To better align the specification names with the
				standard, the Open Package Format specification was renamed EPUB Publications and the
				Open Publication Format specification was renamed EPUB Content Documents. The EPUB 3.0
				specifications were approved in October, 2011. <xref linkend="refPublications30"/>

			<title>Fixed layout metadata</title>

			<para>Fixed layout metadata that was formerly defined in the IDPF Fixed Layout Information
				Document has now been merged into the Publications and Content Documents specifications.
				All of the <olink targetdoc="publications" targetptr="sec-package-metadata-fxl"
					type="epub-spec">fixed-layout metadata properties</olink> are now defined in
				Publications, and support for these properties is now required in Reading

			<title>The <property>rendition:flow</property> property</title>

			<para>The <olink targetdoc="publications" targetptr="layout-property-flow" type="epub-spec"
					>rendition:flow</olink> property was added to allow Authors to indicate the desired
				way in which to flow Content Documents (e.g., to create a continuous flow).</para>
		</section>

		<section xml:id="sec-pub-align-x-center">
			<title>The <property>rendition:align-x-center</property> property</title>

			<para>The <olink targetdoc="publications" targetptr="layout-property-align-x-center" type="epub-spec"
				>rendition:align-x-center</olink> propert was added to enable Authors to specify that
				Content Documents are to be centered horizontally. This property was added primarily to
				handle the problem of Naka-Tobira.</para>

		<section xml:id="sec-cd-trigger-events">

			<para>The following XML Events <xref linkend="refEVENTS"/> have been added to <olink

			<para>The new <xref linkend="refARIA11"/>
				<olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-aria-describedat" type="epub-spec"
					>aria-describedat attribute</olink> has been added, allowing out-of-band descriptions

		<section xml:id="sec-cd-header-footers">

					type="epub-spec">the oeb-page-head and oeb-page-foot properties</olink> is now
				deprecated, as these properties are expected to be removed or replaced in a future

		<section xml:id="sec-cd-schemas">
			<title>RelaxNG schemas</title>

			<para>The Content Documents specification no longer references snapshots of externally
				maintained HTML5 and SVG 1.1 schemas. Validation has now been decoupled so that
				validation can keep current with changes to those specifications, primarily
				HTML5.</para>

			<para>The nature of the contents of an OCF Container have been clarified. An EPUB
				Publication has been formally defined as the single work in the Container, encompassing
				one or more Renditions of it, each represented by a Package Document. It is no longer
				valid for Renditions of different EPUB Publications to be bundled together, although
				this was not encouraged previously.</para>
