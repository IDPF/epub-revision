        <para>EPUB is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and
            Web Standards. An EPUB Publication can be thought of as a reliable packaging of Web

            to distributed for online and offline consumption. </para>

            <title>EPUB Revision History</title>
            <para>EPUB had its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication
                Structure (OEBPS). OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an
                organization that later became the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF)
                Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the IDPF in 2001 and 2002
                respectively.</para>
            <para> It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for
                delivery as well as interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file
                container format for OEPBS, which was approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container
                Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS began in parallel which was
                approved as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007, consisting of a triumvirate of
                specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF) together
                with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set primarily
                intended clarify and correct errata in the specifications, was approved in
                September, 2010. </para>

            <para>This document is part of EPUB3, which is being developed by the IDPF EPUB Working
                Group under a charter [LINK] approved by the IDPF in May, 2010 and is expected to be
                completed and approved by IDPF by May, 2011. </para>
            <para>This document describes the changes in EPUB3 relative to EPUB 2.0.1. Please
                consult the EPUB 2.0.1 specifications for differences between that version and
                earlier versions of EPUB. </para>

        <title>EPUB 2.0.1 Features Replaced in EPUB3</title>
        <para>A number of features in EPUB3 and its building-block Web Standards replace existing
            features in EPUB 2.0.1, and several features in EPUB 2.0.1. that were not widely adopted
            by content authors or Reading Systems are discontinued. Such features, from a content
            conformance perspective, are either <emphasis role="italic">removed</emphasis> (which
            means that conformant EPUB3 content may not use the construct) or <emphasis
                role="italic">deprecated</emphasis> (which means that use of the construct in EPUB3
            is allowed but not recommended. Note that in most cases Reading Systems are for
            backwards compatibility reasons still required to support these constructs, as
            normatively stated in the relevant specifications.</para>
        <para>The following sections list the EPUB 2.0.1 features removed and deprecated in

            <title>DTBook</title>
            <para>DAISY DTBook [REF] was an alternative syntax to XHTML 1.1 for Content Documents in
                OPS 2.0.1 [REF], in order to provide an option for more semantic, and thus more
                accessible, content. As XHTML5 includes intrinsic semantic markup capabilities of a
                similar nature to DTBook, DTBook is no longer an alternative syntax in EPUB3. </para>

                the functionality that this mechanism defined in OPS 2.0.1., beyond baseline
                capabilities of XHTML 1.1, are now part of XHTML5. <remark role="todo">TODO - be

            <title>Filesystem Container</title>
            <para>OCF 3.0 only defines a single-file (ZIP-based) container, and no longer defines a
                "Filesystem Container" abstraction. This changes was made in conjunction with new
                restrictions in Publications 3.0 restricting references to remote resources in EPUB
                Publications to specific contexts. Taken together, these changes mean that the only
                instantiation of an EPUB Publication defined at this time is an EPUB file, and that
                EPUB files must in general contain all constituent parts of the publication, with
                certain well-defined exceptions. </para>
            <para>These changes may seem counter-intuitive given that online consumption of content
                is increasingly prevalent, as are browser-based Reading System implementations. The
                Working Group recognizes this, and understands that in an online environment,
                particularly when browser-based, it will often be inefficient or even impractical to
                download an entire EPUB file to a client system before reading can occur. However, a
                number of significant issues exist for browser-based Reading Systems, including
                cross-domain resource loading restrictions in the browser security model and the
                potential for inadvertent interaction between script-based interactivity within
                EPUB3 content and script-based Reading System implementations. Publishers and
                content distributors providing EPUB content are presently utilizing server-based
                software to manage these issues, in effect creating a distributed client-server
                Reading System in which a packaged EPUB file is ingested on a server and may be
                transformed en route to client software into whatever set of resources is convenient
                for that implementation. Thus there was no pressing requirement to interoperably
                define a distributed form of an EPUB Publication in order to meet the requirements
                of the Working Group charter. </para>
            <para>EPUB 2.x (via the OCF Filesystem container and by being relatively vague in the
                OPF specification about where absolute URLs were legal) can be considered to have
                incompletely described distributed publications without specifying conformance
                requirements for them. This was a combination of historical (with respect to OPF
                which was a revision to a predecessor specification that pre-dated any ZIP-based
                container) and aspirational (with respect to OCF) factors. </para>
            <para>Since the Working Group did have a goal to improve the interoperability of the
                EPUB ecosystem by increasing the clarity and rigor of our conformance requirements,
                it was decided that these partial definitions were unhelpful and should be removed
                from the EPUB3 base specifications. However, the Working Group understands that
                networked publications will be increasingly important and expects future work to
                include development of robust interoperable conformance definitions for distributed
                EPUB Publications based on emerging content publisher and Reading System
                requirements.</para>

            <para>OPF 2.0.1. specified an optional extension mechanism enabling a spine item to be

                adopted by content or Reading Systems, and has been removed from EPUB3, which also
                defines a more powerful script-based extensibility mechanism. As a result the
