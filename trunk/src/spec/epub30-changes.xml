            <para>EPUB 3 defines the third major revision of EPUB, a digital publication interchange
                and delivery format based on XML and Web Standards. This document informatively

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>EPUBÂ® is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and
            Web Standards. An EPUB Publication can be thought of as a reliable packaging of Web
            content that represents a digital book, magazine, or other type of publication, and able
            to distributed for online and offline consumption. </para>

        <para>This document, EPUB 3 Changes from EPUB 2.0.1, describes changes made in the third
            major revision of EPUB, including some rationale for the changes, and some guidance for
            content authors and Reading System developers regarding backwards compatibility
            considerations.</para>

            <title>EPUB Revision History</title>

            <para>EPUB had its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication
                Structure (OEBPS). OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an
                organization that later became the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).
                Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the IDPF in 2001 and 2002
                respectively.</para>

            <para> It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for
                delivery as well as interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file
                container format for OEPBS, which was approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container
                Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS began in parallel which was
                approved as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007, consisting of a triumvirate of
                specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF) together
                with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set primarily
                intended clarify and correct errata in the specifications, was approved in
                September, 2010. <xref linkend="refOPF2"/>

        <title>Changes to EPUB Specification Documents</title>
        <para>In addition to significant changes in functionality, the EPUB 3 specifications are

            been made to improve clarity. The following sections describe these changes.</para>

                <para>OCF 3.0 <xref linkend="refOCF30"/> only defines a single-file (ZIP-based)
                    container, and no longer defines a "Filesystem Container" abstraction. This
                    change was made in conjunction with new restrictions in Publications 3.0
                    restricting references to remote resources in EPUB Publications to specific
                    media types and contexts. Taken together, these changes mean that the only
                    instantiation of an EPUB Publication defined at this time is the EPUB ZIP
                    Container, and that EPUB files must in general contain all constituent parts of
                    the Publication, with certain well-defined exceptions. </para>
                <para>These changes may seem counter-intuitive given that online consumption of
                    content is increasingly prevalent, as are browser-based Reading System
                    implementations. The Working Group recognizes this, and understands that in an
                    online environment, particularly when browser-based, it will often be
                    inefficient or even impractical to download an entire EPUB file to a client
                    system before reading can occur. A number of significant issues exist for
                    browser-based Reading Systems, however, including cross-domain resource loading
                    restrictions in the browser security model and the potential for inadvertent
                    interaction between script-based interactivity within EPUB 3 content and
                    script-based Reading System implementations. Publishers and content distributors
                    providing EPUB content are presently utilizing server-based software to manage
                    these issues, in effect creating a distributed client-server Reading System in
                    which a packaged EPUB file is ingested on a server and may be transformed en
                    route to client software into whatever set of resources is convenient for that
                    implementation. Consequently, there was no pressing requirement to define an
                    interoperable distributed form of an EPUB Publication in order to meet the
                    requirements of the Working Group charter. </para>
                <para>EPUB 2.x (via the OCF Filesystem container and by being relatively vague in
                    the OPF specification about where absolute URLs were legal) can be considered to
                    have incompletely described distributed publications without specifying
                    conformance requirements for them. This was a combination of historical (with
                    respect to OPF which was a revision to a predecessor specification that
                    pre-dated any ZIP-based container) and aspirational (with respect to OCF)
                    factors. </para>
                <para>Since the Working Group did have a goal to improve the interoperability of the
                    EPUB ecosystem by increasing the clarity and rigor of our conformance
                    requirements, it was decided that these partial definitions were unhelpful and
                    should be removed from the EPUB 3 base specifications. The Working Group
                    understands that networked Publications will be increasingly important, and
                    expects future work to include development of robust interoperable conformance
                    definitions for distributed EPUB Publications based on emerging content
                    publisher and Reading System requirements.</para>
