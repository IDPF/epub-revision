            <title>EPUB3 Overview</title>
            <para>EPUB3 is the third major revision of an interchange and delivery format for
                digital publications based on XML and Web Standards. EPUB3 is defined by a set of
                specification documents, including this document. This document serves as the
                overall introduction to EPUB3, describing the other EPUB3 documents and reviewing
                cross-cutting concerns including accessibility, metadata, and global language
                support.</para>

                Standards.</para>
            <para>This document is intended to provide a starting point for content authors and
                software developers wishing to understand EPUB3. It consists of non-normative
                overview material including a roadmap for the modular building-block specification
                documents that comprise EPUB3. These other documents include:</para>

            <para>This document also provides non-normative information about cross-cutting concerns
                applicable to EPUB usage. These include sections on accessibility, metadata, and
                global language support.</para>
            <para>Note that another non-normative document "EPUB3 Differences from EPUB 2.0.1"
                describes changes in EPUB3 from the previous verison, EPUB 2.0.1. That document also
                provides historical context about EPUB's evolution since its origins in 1999 as
                OEBPS, and is expected to be of interest primarily to content authors and Reading
                System vendors migrating from EPUB 2.0.1 to EPUB3, or who anticipate supporting both
                versions.</para>

    <chapter xml:id="sec-opf-introduction">
        <title>Introduction to EPUB</title>
        <para>EPUB is structured and semantically enhanced web content (HTML5, CSS, SVG, images,
            etc.) in a single-file package. EPUB publications have well-defined reading order,
            navigation, and metadata, and the content meets reliability constraints (including use
            of XML serialization and separation of scripting from other content) that are intended
            to enable dynamic rendering (including paginated formatting and text-to-speech) based on
            device characteristics and user preferences.</para>
        <para>An EPUB file is a ZIP-based archive that has the file extension ".epub". Such EPUB
            files are also conformant ZIP archives that can be "unzipped" by many software programs.
            A minimal "Hello World" EPUB file that has been unzipped into a directory comprises
            three files and might look like the following example:</para>
        <para><informalexample>
                <synopsis>
META-INF/container.xml
Content/HelloWorld.opf
Content/HelloWorld.xhtml
 </synopsis>
            </informalexample></para>
        <para>While conceptually simple, an EPUB file is more than just a collection of HTML pages
            and dependent assets in a ZIP package. A key concept in EPUB is that a publication
            consists of multiple resources that may be completely navigated and consumed by a person
            (or program) <emphasis role="italic">in</emphasis>
            <emphasis role="italic">some specific order</emphasis> that can be reliably determined.
            That is not true in general of a collection of HTML pages. A novel has a beginning,
            middle and end - it is highly sequential. Not all publications are as sequential as a
            novel; a cookbook or collection of photographic images might be considered to be more
            like a database. But even a cookbook has at least one logical ordering of all its
            top-level content items (most likely, recipes), whether that be by date, by topic, by
            location or some other ordering. In every EPUB publication there is at least one logical
            ordering of all top-level content that can be consumed in that "reading order", as well
            as a declarative "table of contents" and potentially additional ways to navigate into
            that content. And in EPUB these data structures exist in a machine-readable way
                <emphasis role="italic">external</emphasis> to the content items themselves. This
            does not limit content to a linear ordering of information or preclude content items
            directly linking in arbitrary ways - after all the Web is built on hypertext - but it
            means that basic consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that
            is not true for a set of HTML pages.</para>
        <para>Another key concept in EPUB is that content presentation should adapt to the user,
            rather than the user having to adapt to a particular presentation of content. HTML was
            originally designed to support dynamic rendering of structured content, but over time
            HTML as supported in web browsers has become focused on the needs of Web applications,
            and most popular websites now have fixed-format layouts. EPUB publications are designed
            to maximize accessibility to the visually impaired, and systems that display EPUB
            (called "Reading Systems") typically perform text line layout and pagination "on the
            fly", adapting to the size of the display area, the user's preferred font size, and
            other environmental factor. This behavior is not guaranteed in EPUB - images, vector
            graphics, video, and other content can be included, and such content may not be
            "reflowable", and some Reading Systems may not do pagination "on the fly" or at all -
            but supporting dynamic adaptive layout and accessibility has been a primary design
            consideration throughout the evolution of the EPUB standard. One corollary of this
            concept is that EPUB strives to treat content <emphasis role="italic"
                >declaratively</emphasis> - as data that can be manipulated, not programs that must
            be executed. So for example use of JavaScript scripting in EPUB content documents is
            disabled by default, must be explicitly requested as part of specifying a content
            document within a larger publication, and may not be supported by all Reading
            Systems.</para>
        <para>The followings sections introduce the components of EPUB in more detail</para>
        <section xml:id="sec-ocf-overview-intro">
            <title>Content Documents</title>
            <para>Every EPUB publication contains one or more Content Documents. These are XHTML or
                SVG files (or a mix of both) that describe the top-level content that a user may
                read. EPUB3 Content Documents are a restricted subset HTML5; in particular, use of
                the XML serialization (XHTML5) is required in order to ensure that content can be
                reliably manipulated and rendered. But there is no magic here: any Content Document
                from an EPUB can be rendered by an HTML5 Web Browser (although it might not look the
                same - in particular, Web Browsers usually provide an infinitely scrolling viewport,
                and EPUB Reading Systems usually paginate content).</para>
            <para>EPUB Content Documents can optionally reference CSS Style Sheets. EPUB defines a
                profile of CSS that is a superset of CSS 2.1 that includes some capabilities defined
                in Modules of CSS3. Again, there is no magic here, and this CSS consists of features
                that are generally supported by HTML5 Web Browsers. as well as some additional
                properties that will be ignored by browsers that don't understand them.</para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="sec-overview-package-file">
            <title> Package File </title>
            <para>On websites, references to resources are embedded within content. This is simple
                and flexible, but. makes it difficult to enumerate all the resources required by a
                given web page. As well, there is no standard way for websites to define a sequence
                of pages that make up a larger publication , i..e. there's no standard way to
                specify navigation between content documents. Finally, there's no standard way to
                represent metadata applicable to the overall publication EPUB publications therefore
                include a Package File, an XML document that specifies all its constituent content
                documents and their required resources, defines a reading order for linear
                consumption of top-level content documents, and </para>
            <para>Also a starting point - rather than looking for a special name like "index.html"
                Reading Systems can start with the Package File...</para>

            <para>EPUB3 supports two closely-related font formats: OpenType and WOFF. Support for
                both formats is required to accommodate both traditional publishing workflows
                centered around OpenType and emerging web-based workflows which utilize WOFF. EPUB3
                also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources (for either OpenType or
                WOFF font formats). Support for obfuscated font resources is required to accommodate
                font licensing restrictions for many commercially-available fonts. </para>
            <para> For example, a word processing program is likely to have access only to a
                collection of the installed OpenType fonts and not their WOFF equivalents (if the
                font is even licensed as WOFF). Similarly, a web-archival EPUB generator will likely
                only have access to WOFF resources and cannot convert it to OpenType without
                undesirable stripping of WOFF metadata. </para>
