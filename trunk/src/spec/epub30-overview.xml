            <title>EPUB3 Overview</title>
            <para>EPUB3 is the third major revision of an interchange and delivery format for
                digital publications based on XML and Web Standards. EPUB3 is defined by a set of
                specification documents, including this document. This document serves as the
                overall introduction to EPUB3, describing the other EPUB3 documents and reviewing
                cross-cutting concerns including accessibility, metadata, and global language

        <title>Introduction</title>
        
        <para>The EPUB specification is a distribution and interchange format standard for
            digital publications and documents. EPUB defines a means of
            representing, packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content 
            — including HTML5, CSS, SVG, images, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file format.</para>
        
        <para>The EPUB specification has been widely adopted as the format for digital books
            (eBooks), and EPUB3 significantly increases the format's capabilities in order to
            better support a wider range of publication requirements, including complex layouts,
            rich media and interactivity, and global typography features. The expectation is
            that EPUB3 will be utilized for a broad range of content, including books, magazines
            and educational, professional and scientific publications.</para>

        <title>EPUB3 Publications</title>
        
        <para>Each <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/> has a well-defined
            reading order and includes a declarative means of navigating its content. In
            addition to including semantically rich metadata, the content also meets
            reliability constraints — including the use of XML serialization and separation of
            scripting from other content — intended to enable dynamic rendering, such as
            paginated formatting and text-to-speech, based on device characteristics and User
            preferences.</para>
        
        <para>An EPUB Publication is typically bundled as a ZIP-based archive with the file
            extension <literal>.epub</literal> for distribution. As conformant ZIP archives,
            Publications can be unzipped by many software programs, simplifying both their production
            and consumption. A minimal "Hello World" EPUB file that has been unzipped into a
            directory may comprise three files, and might look like the following example:</para>
        
        <informalexample>
            <synopsis>
META-INF/container.xml
Content/HelloWorld.opf
Content/HelloWorld.xhtml
</synopsis>
        </informalexample>
        
        <para>While conceptually simple, an EPUB file is more than just a collection of HTML
            pages and dependent assets in a ZIP package. A key concept of EPUB is that a
            Publication consists of multiple resources that may be completely navigated and
            consumed by a person or program <emphasis role="italic">in some specific
                order</emphasis>. This order can be reliably determined, which is typically not
            true of a collection of HTML pages.</para>
        
        <para>Many publications have an obvious reading order, or
            logical progression through their content. A novel is an example of a highly
            sequential document, as it typically has a beginning, middle and end, but not all
            publications are so ordered: a cookbook or collection of photographic images might
            be considered to be more like a database. All documents do, however, have at least
            one logical ordering of all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic,
            location or some other criteria (e.g., a cookbook is typically ordered by recipe
            types).</para>
        
        <para>Every EPUB Publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its
            top-level content, as well as a declarative table of contents. Publications make
            these data structures available in a machine-readable way <emphasis role="italic"
                >external</emphasis> to the content items themselves, simplifying their
            discovery and use.</para>
        
        <para>EPUB Publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents, nor do
            they preclude linking in arbitrary ways — the Web is built on hypertext —
            but the basic consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that
            is not true for a set of HTML pages.</para>
    
        <para>Another key concept in EPUB is that content presentation should adapt to the <xref
            linkend="gloss-user"/>, rather than the User having to adapt to a particular
            presentation of content. HTML was originally designed to support dynamic rendering
            of structured content, but over time HTML as supported in Web browsers has become
            focused on the needs of Web applications, and most popular Web sites now have
            fixed-format layouts. EPUB Publications are designed to maximize accessibility to
            the visually impaired, and <xref linkend="gloss-epub-reading-system"/>s typically
            perform text line layout and pagination on the fly, adapting to the size of the
            display area, the User's preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This
            behavior is not guaranteed in EPUB — images, vector graphics, video, and other
            content can be included, and such content may not be reflowable, and some Reading
            Systems may not do pagination on the fly, or at all — but supporting dynamic
            adaptive layout and accessibility has been a primary design consideration throughout
            the evolution of the EPUB standard.</para>
        
        <para>One corollary to this concept is that EPUB strives to treat content <emphasis
            role="italic">declaratively</emphasis> — as data that can be manipulated, not
            programs that must be executed. So, for example, use of JavaScript scripting in EPUB
            content documents is disabled by default <remark role="todo">Garth: is this really true?  
                What about a "script" element found in a content document that isn't correctly declared 
                as containing spine-level scripting? In 2.0.1 this was a "should not execute" the contained
                script.</remark>, must be explicitly requested as part of specifying a content 
            document within a larger publication, and may not be supported by all Reading Systems.</para>
        
        <para>The following sections introduce the four major components of EPUB Publications
            (package file, content documents, media overlays, and container), which correspond
            to the four building-block specifications that collectively define the EPUB3
            format.</para>
            
        
        <section xml:id="sec-package-file">
            <title>Package Document</title>
            
            <para>Every EPUB Publication includes a single <xref linkend="gloss-package-document"/>,
                an XML document that specifies all its constituent content documents and their
                required resources, defines a reading order for linear consumption, and associates
                publication-level metadata and navigation information.</para>
            
            <para>A typical Web site, on the other hand, embeds references to its resources within
                its content, which, while a simple and flexible means of identifying them, makes it
                difficult to enumerate all the resources required by a given Web page. As well,
                there is no standard way for a Web site to define that a sequence of pages make up a
                larger publication (i.e., there is no external declarative means to explicitly
                specify navigation through a collection of HTML documents). Likewise, there is no
                standard way to represent metadata applicable globally to such a collection.</para>
            
            <para>An EPUB Publication's Package Document addresses all of these issues, and
                declaratively defines the root of the publication. The Package file and other
                publication-level constructs are specified in <xref linkend="refPublications3"
                />.</para>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-content-docs">
            <title>Content Documents</title>

            <para>Every EPUB Publication contains one or more <xref
                    linkend="gloss-content-document-epub"/>, as defined in <xref
                    linkend="refContentDocs3"/>. These are XHTML or SVG documents that describe the
                readable content of a Publication and reference associated media resources (e.g.,
                images, audio and video clips).</para>

            <para><xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-xhtml"/>s are defined by a
                profile of HTML5 that requires the use of XML serialization <xref linkend="refHTML5"
                /> in order to ensure that content can be reliably manipulated and rendered. This
                profile also adds two additional EPUB-specific language constructs: the <olink
                    targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="attrdef-epub-type" type="epub-spec"/>
                attribute for element-level metadata and the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="sec-xhtml-epub-trigger" type="epub-spec">epub:trigger</olink> element
                for declaratively associating controls with multimedia elements. These additions do
                not affect the ability of an HTML5 User Agent <xref linkend="refHTML5"/> to render
                EPUB XHTML Content Documents, but Publications may not render identically in all
                User Agents (notably, Web browsers typically provide an infinitely scrolling <xref
                    linkend="gloss-viewport"/> while EPUB Reading Systems typically paginate
                content).</para>

            <para>EPUB Content Documents can optionally reference <xref linkend="gloss-stylesheet"
                />s to define the desired rendering properties. EPUB3 defines a profile of CSS based
                on CSS 2.1 <xref linkend="refCSS21"/> for this purpose, together with capabilities
                defined by various CSS3 Modules as well as several additional properties specific to
                EPUB. The CSS3 properties that have been selected were done so based on their
                current level of support by Web browsers, but some properties may not affect rendering by
                Reading Systems and User Agents (support for the EPUB-defined properties may
                be similarly inefectual).</para>

            <para>Every EPUB3 Publication also contains a special XHTML Content Document called the
                    <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/>, which uses the HTML5
                    <code>nav</code> element to define human- and machine-readable navigation
                information, as defined in <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-nav"
                    type="epub-spec"/>.</para>
            
            <para>The Navigation Document supersedes and obsoletes the NCX document <xref linkend="refOPS2"/>,
                and the inclusion of NCX documents is only recommended for forward compatiblity in older 
                Reading Systems. The Navigation Document, while maintaining the baseline accessibility and
                navigation support and features of the NCX, introduces new functionality and rendering features
                to ehance navigation for all Users. Prime among these are better support for internationalization —
                as an XHTML5 document itself, the Navigation Document natively supports Ruby — and support for 
                embedded grammars — MathML and SVG can be included within navigation links. As XHTML documents, 
                Navigation Documents also provide a flexible means of tailoring the navigation display using CSS while
                not impacting access to information for accessible Reading Systems.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-media-overlays">
            <title>Media Overlays </title>
            
            <para>An EPUB Publication may optionally contain one or more <xref
                linkend="gloss-media-overlay-document"/>s, which provide a means to associate
                pre-recorded audio with textual/visual content to facilitate synchronized playback.
                Media Overlay Documents are specified via a subset of <link linkend="refSMIL"
                    >SMIL</link>, as defined in <xref linkend="refOverlays3"/>. </para>
            
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-container">
            <title>Container</title>

            <para>An EPUB Publication is transported and interchanged as a single file (a "portable
                document") that contains the Package Document, all Content Documents, and all other
                required resources for processing the Publication. The single-file container format
                for EPUB is based on the widely adopted ZIP format. An XML manifest
                that specifies the location in the ZIP archive of the package file must be found 
                at a well-defined location within the archive.</para>

            <para>This approach provides a clear contract between any creator of an EPUB publication
                and any system which consumes such publications, as well as a reliable
                representation that is independent of network transport or file system
                specifics.</para>

        <para>This section covers a number of important topics that span the <link

            authoring <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/>s as a whole. As EPUB3 is a new
            version of the EPUB specification and builds on a number of relatively new Web Standards
            like HTML5, best practices are still emerging, and the guidelines described here should

                        targetptr="sec-opf-metadata-identifiers-uid" type="epub-spec"/>, a Package
                    Document's Author is responsible for including a primary identifier that is
                    unique to one and only one particular EPUB Publication. This requirement can be
                    challenging, particularly given that the definition of a particular EPUB
                    Publication is inherently fuzzy.</para>

                <para>There is no simple solution to the uniqueness problem, however, except to
                    ensure that identifiers are created in a non-trivial fashion. Although EPUB3
                    does not attempt to formally specify how identifiers should be constructed, some
                    recommendations are to not rely on simple integer values or timestamps alone as
                    the means of identifying Publications. Identifiers that combine spatial,
                    temporal and random character data are significantly less likely to
                    occur in duplicate than those that rely on common data types.</para>

            <section xml:id="sec-id-persistence">
                <title>Persist Identifiers</title>

                <para>Not every release of an EPUB Publication warrants the issuing of a new unique
                    identifier, nor is it typically desirable (especially in the case of minor
                    formatting and errata fixes). A Publication's unique identifier represents the
                    primary means of referencing and linking to the Publication, and also assists in
                    distribution channels to identify that the Publication does not represent a new
                    instance. Changing this identifier should consequently only be undertaken when
                    the Publication must be identified and handled as a new instance.</para>

                <para>Persisting the identifier, however, causes the secondary problem of needing to
                    reliably distinguish one version of the same Publication from another. EPUB3
                    adds the <olink targetdoc="publications"
                        targetptr="sec-opf-metadata-identifiers-pid" type="epub-spec"/> for exactly
                    this purpose. The Package Identifier is created by combining the unique
                    identifier with the last modification date of the Publication to create a new
                    identifier that can be used to sequentially order different releases of the same
                    Publication. Authors are consequently encouraged to use this method of
                    identification to release updates than the practice of creating a new unique
                    identifier each time.</para>

                <para>EPUB3 does not require that Reading Systems come with any particular set of

                    may have installed fonts that omit characters required for other locales, and
                    Reading Systems may utilize intrinsic fonts or font engines that do not utilize operating
                    system installed fonts. Embedding fonts is consequently recommended in order to

            <para>EPUB3 supports two closely-related font formats: OpenType <xref
                    linkend="refOpenType"/> and WOFF <xref linkend="refWOFF"/>. Reading System
                support for both formats is required to accommodate both traditional publishing
                workflows centered around OpenType and emerging Web-based workflows which utilize
                WOFF. For example, word processing programs used to create Publications are likely
                to have access only to a collection of the installed OpenType fonts, while
                Web-archival EPUB generators will likely only have access to WOFF resources which
                cannot be converted to OpenType without undesirable (and potentially unlicensed)
                stripping of WOFF metadata.</para>

            <para>EPUB3 also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources for both OpenType
                and WOFF font formats. Support for obfuscated font resources is required to
                accommodate font licensing restrictions for many commercially-available
                fonts.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-scripting">
            <title>Scripting</title>

            <para>EPUB3 supports scripting via JavaScript, as defined in <link linkend="refHTML5"
                    >HTML5</link> and <link linkend="refSVG">SVG</link> (refer to <olink
                    targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-scripted-content" type="epub-spec"/> for
                more information). It is important to note, however, that scripting support is
                optional for Reading Systems, and may be disabled for security reasons. As a result,
                Authors should not create content that requires scripts to be run. As well, Authors
                should be aware that scripting in an EPUB publication can create security
                considerations that are different than scripting within a Web browser. For example,
                typical same origin policy restrictions are not applicable to content that has been
                downloaded to a User's local system. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that
                scripting be limited to container constrained contexts, as further described in
                    <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-scripted-content-content-reqs"
                    type="epub-spec"/>.</para>

            <para><xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub"/>s that contain scripted content must
                be marked accordingly in the Publication's <olink targetdoc="publications"
                    targetptr="sec-manifest-elem" type="epub-spec"><code>manifest</code></olink>.
                Scripting should be used only when essential to the User
                experience, as it greatly increases the likelihood that content will not be portable
                across all Reading Systems and creates barriers to accessibility and content
                reusability.</para>

            <para>Several mechanisms in EPUB can further minimize and constrain scripting within

                        which case a Reading System may provide a means for Users to access an
                        expanded view that is out-of-line with the normal layout. Such rollover
                        effects are typically implemented via scripting in Web contexts, but
                        scripting cannot be readily implemented given the wide variety of layouts
                        that a Reading System may generate.</para>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>A major goal of EPUB is to facilitate content accessibility, and a variety of
                features in EPUB3 support this requirement. This section reviews these features
                in the context of some established best practices for ensuring that EPUB
                Publications are accessible.</para>
            
            <para>One of the key new accessibility features in EPUB3 is the inclusion of 
                <xref linkend="gloss-media-overlay-document"/>s <xref linkend="refOverlays3"/>.
                Media Overlays provide the abilty to synchronize pre-recorded audio narration with 
                the text of a Content Document, a feature already familiar to readers of DAISY Digital Talking
                Books.</para>
            
            <para>EPUB3 also improves on NCX documents with the addition of 
                <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/>s. As noted in 
                <xref linkend="sec-content-docs"/> above, the new features these provide
                represents a more universal and flexible navigation system.</para>
            
            <para>It is important to note that while accessibility is important in its own
                right, accessible content is also more valuable content: an accessible
                publication will be adaptable to more devices and be easier to reuse, in whole
                or in part, via human and automated workflows. The EPUB Working Group strongly
                recommends that Authors use EPUB tools that generate accessible content.</para>

            <title>Ensure Full Navigation</title>
            
            <para>The need to navigate a document is not exclusively an accessibility issue, but a complete
                <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/> is key to being able to easily and fully
                access the contents of a document. Authors should always ensure that the primary <property>toc</property>

                fully reflects the structure of their documents.</para>
                
            <para>For highly structured documents, it may not be desirable to display the
                complete table of contents to Users, but the display level can be modified using the CSS 
                <property>display</property> property without minimizing the information that is available
                for accessible <xref linkend="gloss-epub-reading-system"/>s.</para>
            
            <para>Authors should supply additional <code>nav</code> elements if their Publications
                contain non-structural points of interest, such as figures, tables, etc. to further enhance
                access to the content.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-semantic-markup">
            <title>Create Semantically-Rich Markup</title>
            <para>Authors should strive to make the markup in their <xref
                linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-xhtml"/>s as semantically rich as
                possible, as the more detail a document contains the easier it is for Reading
                Systems to discover and interact with those documents.</para>
            <para>HTML5 supports a number of new elements intended to make markup more
                semantically meaningful (<code>section</code>, <code>nav</code>,
                <code>aside</code>) as well as introduces more clearly defined semantics for
                some HTML4 elements. These elements, in conjunction with best practices for
                authoring well-structured Web content should be utilized when creating EPUB
                XHTML Content Documents. These additions allow content to be better grouped and
                defined, both for representing the structure of documents and to facilitate
                their logical navigation. XHTML Content Documents also natively support the
                inclusion of ARIA role and state attributes and events, enhancing the ability of
                Assistive Technologies to interact with the content.</para>
            <para>EPUB3 further introduces the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                targetptr="attrdef-epub-type" type="epub-spec"/> attribute, which is meant
                to be functionally equivalent to the W3C Role Attribute <xref
                    linkend="refPFRoleAttribute"/>. This attribute allows any element in an
                XHTML Content Document to include additional information about its purpose and
                meaning within the work, using controlled vocabularies and terms. Refer to

            <para>The design center of EPUB is dynamic layout — content is typically intended to
                be formatted on the fly rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in
                advance (i.e. expecting a particular sized "page"). This core capability is useful, for example, for optimizing rendering
                onto different sized device screens or window sizes, and also facilitates and simplifies content
                accessibility vs. formats that are inherently final-form (such as bitmap page
                images and PDF). </para>
            
            <para>While it is possible to incorporate more highly formatted content in EPUB, for
                example via bitmap images or SVG graphics, or even use of CSS explicit
                positioning and/or table elements to achieve particular visual layouts, Authors
                are strongly discouraged from utilizing such techniques. They are not reliable
                in EPUB, since Reading Systems typically render content in a paginated manner
                rather than creating a single scrolling <xref linkend="gloss-viewport"/>, and
                the particular pagination algorithm used is Reading System dependent. If these
                techniques are required to convey the content of the publication (for example,
                for graphic novels), <olink targetdoc="publications"
                    targetptr="sec-fallback-processing-flow" type="epub-spec">fallbacks</olink>
                should always be included.</para>
            
            <para>In general, it is preferable to achieve visual richness by using <xref
                linkend="gloss-stylesheet"/>s without explicit sizing or positioning.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-aural-rendering">
            <title>Include Aural Rendering</title>
            <para>Aural renditions of content are important for accessibility and are a
                desirable feature for many other Users. A baseline to facilitate aural rendering
                is to utilize semantic HTML designed for dynamic layout. Refer to <xref
                    linkend="sec-tts"/> for more information on how to use the native facilities
                that EPUB XHTML Documents include. </para>
            <para>When pre-recorded audio narration is available for a Publication, EPUB3 also
                allows <xref linkend="gloss-media-overlay-document"/>s for synchronizing the
                audio and text presentation for Users. Refer to <olink targetdoc="mediaoverlays"
                    targetptr="sec-media-overlays-docs" type="epub-spec"/> for more
                information.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-accessibility-fallbacks">
            <title>Provide Fallbacks</title>
            <para>Not all formats are accessible in their native format, and not all Users may
                prefer to read in the default format provided. EPUB defines a variety of means
                for providing fallbacks so that alternate renditions of a Publication can be
                made available in these cases.</para>
            
            <para>Publication and content-level fallbacks are defined in <olink
                targetdoc="publications" targetptr="sec-fallback-processing-flow"
                type="epub-spec"/>. These allow for the alternate rendition of specific
                resources within a Publication, such as SVG images or video clips.</para>
            <para>In addition, multiple instances of a complete work can be delivered in a
                single Publication by defining multiple <code>rootfile</code> elements in the
                OCF container file (as described in <olink targetdoc="ocf"
                    targetptr="sec-container-metainf-container.xml" type="epub-spec"/>). This
                kind of fallback may be used, for example, to deliver a formatted graphic novel
                defined via a sequence of SVG pages to be accompanied by a textual version
                defined via XHTML.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-accessibility-scripting">
            <title>Avoid Scripting</title>
            <para>Although EPUB3 supports scripting in Content Documents (as defined in <olink
                targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-scripted-content" type="epub-spec"
            />), programmatic scripting presents inherent accessibility challenges.</para>
            <para>Best practices for use of scripting in Web documents should be consulted, such
                as provided in the <remark role="todo">WAI-ARIA 1.0 Primer <xref
                    linkend="refWAPRIMER"/></remark>, and use of scripting should be
                reserved for situations in which interactivity is critical to the User
                experience.</para>
