            <title>EPUB 3 Overview</title>
            <para>EPUB 3 is the third major revision of an interchange and delivery format for
                digital publications based on XML and Web Standards. EPUB 3 is defined by a set of
                specification documents, including this document. This document serves as the
                overall introduction to EPUB 3, describing the other EPUB 3 documents and reviewing
                cross-cutting concerns including accessibility, metadata, and global language
                support.</para>

            <para>The EPUB® specification is a distribution and interchange format standard for
                digital publications and documents. EPUB defines a means of
                representing, packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content 
                — including HTML5, CSS, SVG, images, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file format.</para>
            
            <para xml:id="sibling-specs">EPUB 3, the third major release of the standard, consists of a set of four 
                specifications, each defining an important component of an overall EPUB Publication:</para>
            
            <itemizedlist xml:id="epub-specs-listing">
                <xi:include href="./share/specdesc-publications.xml"/>

                <xi:include href="./share/specdesc-overlays.xml"/>
            </itemizedlist>
            
            <para>EPUB has been widely adopted as the format for digital books
                (eBooks), and these new specifications significantly increase the format's capabilities in order to
                better support a wider range of publication requirements, including complex layouts,
                rich media and interactivity, and global typography features. The expectation is
                that EPUB 3 will be utilized for a broad range of content, including books, magazines
                and educational, professional and scientific publications.</para>
            
            <para>This document provides a starting point for content authors and software 
                developers wishing to understand these specifications. It consists of non-normative overview 
                material, including a <link linkend="sec-intro-roadmap">roadmap</link> to the four building-block
                specification documents that compose EPUB 3.</para>
            
          <para>Another non-normative document, EPUB 3 Changes from EPUB 2.0.1 <xref
                linkend="refEPUB3Changes"/>, describes changes in EPUB 3 from the previous
                version, but is intended primarily for <xref linkend="gloss-author"/>s and
                <xref linkend="gloss-epub-reading-system"/> vendors migrating from EPUB 2.0.1 to
                EPUB 3, or those who anticipate supporting both versions.</para>

            <title>Roadmap</title>
            
            <para>This section provides a quick-start guide to the EPUB 3 specifications by means of decomposing
                a Publication from its practical form in a container into its component parts. Links to additional 
                information within this document and to the specifications are included as a trail for further investigation.</para>
            
            <para>An <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/>, at its most basic level, is a bundled collection 
                of resources that can be reliably and predictably ingested by an <xref linkend="gloss-epub-reading-system"/>
                in order to render its contents to a <xref linkend="gloss-user"/>. Some of these resources
                facilitate the discovery and processing of the Publication, while others make up 
                the content of the publication. These latter <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub"/>s are described
                in <xref linkend="sec-content-docs"/> and are fully defined in <xref linkend="refContentDocs3"/>.</para>
            
            <para>A Publication's resources are typically bundled as a ZIP-based archive with the file
                extension <literal>.epub</literal> for distribution. As conformant ZIP archives, Publications can be 
                unzipped by many software programs, simplifying both their production and consumption. An 
                introduction to this container format is provided in <xref linkend="sec-container"/> and it is fully 
                defined in <xref linkend="refOCF30"/>.</para>
            
            <para>The container format not only provides a predictable means
                of discovering that the zipped content represents an EPUB Publication (the <filename>mimetype</filename>
                file), but also provides a universally-named directory of informative resources 
                (<filename>/META-INF</filename>). Key among these is the <filename>container.xml</filename> file, which directs
                Reading Systems to the root file of the Publication, the <xref linkend="gloss-package-document"/>.</para>
            
            <para>The Package Document is itself a kind of information warehouse for the Publication, storing metadata
                about the specific work contained in the Publication, providing an exhaustive list of resources 
                and defining a default reading order. An overview of this document is provided in 
                <xref linkend="sec-package-file"/> and it is defined in <xref linkend="refPublications3"/>.</para>
            
            <para>The preceding components of an EPUB Publication are not new to EPUB 3, and will be familiar
                to anyone who has worked with Publications before (although changed and enhanced in this version).
                A new core addition to EPUB 3, however, is the <xref linkend="gloss-media-overlay-document"/>, which 
                defines a means of synchronizing text and audio playback. An introduction to this document is 
                provided in <xref linkend="sec-access-overlays"/> and it is defined in <xref linkend="refOverlays3"/>.</para>
            
            <para>A minimal "Hello World" Publication that incorporates all of the above components and features 
                might contain the resources listed in the following example:</para>
            
            <informalexample>
                <synopsis>

META-INF/container.xml
Content/HelloWorld.opf
Content/HelloWorld.xhtml
Content/HelloWorld.smil
Content/HelloWorld.mp3
</synopsis>
            </informalexample>
            
            <para>While conceptually simple, an EPUB Publication is more than just a collection of HTML
                pages and dependent assets in a ZIP package as represented in this example. The following
                sections of this document delve into more detail about the primary features and functionality
                that Publications provide to enhance the reading experience.</para>

    <chapter xml:id="sec-features">
        <title>Features</title>

        <para>This section covers the major features of EPUB, including important components and topics that 
            apply to the process of authoring <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/>s as a whole.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-package-file">
            <title>Package Document</title>
            
            <para>Every EPUB Publication includes a single <xref linkend="gloss-package-document"/>,
                which specifies all the Publication's constituent content documents and their
                required resources, defines a reading order for linear consumption, and associates
                publication-level metadata and navigation information.</para>
            
            <para>The Package Document represents a significant improvement on a typical Web site. 
                A Web site, for example, embeds references to its resources within its content, which, while a simple and 
                flexible means of identifying resources, makes it difficult to enumerate all the resources 
                required to render it. As well, there is no standard way for a Web site to define that a 
                sequence of pages make up a
                larger publication, which is precisely what the <code>spine</code> element does 
                (i.e., it provides an external declarative means to explicitly
                specify navigation through a collection of documents). Likewise, the Package Document
                solves the problem Web sites suffer of not having a
                standard way to represent metadata globally applicable to a collection of pages.</para>
            
            <para>The Package file and other publication-level constructs are specified in 
                <xref linkend="refPublications3"/>.</para>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-nav">
            <title>Navigation</title>
            
            <section xml:id="sec-nav-order">
                <title>Reading Order</title>
                
                <para>A key concept of 
                    EPUB is that a Publication consists of multiple resources that may be completely navigated and 
                    consumed by a person or program <emphasis role="italic">in some specific order</emphasis>.</para>
                
                <para>Many publications have an obvious reading order, or
                    logical progression through their content. A novel is an example of a highly
                    sequential document — as it typically has a beginning, middle and end — but not all
                    publications are so ordered: a cookbook or collection of photographic images might
                    be considered to be more like a database. All documents do, however, have at least
                    one logical ordering of all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic,
                    location or some other criteria (e.g., a cookbook is typically ordered by recipe
                    types).</para>
                
                <para>Every EPUB Publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its
                    top-level content (the <olink targetdoc="publications" targetptr="sec-spine-elem" type="epub-spec"/>), 
                    as well as a declarative table of contents (the <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/> 
                    <xref linkend="refContentDocs3"/>).
                    Publications make these data structures available in a machine-readable way <emphasis role="italic"
                        >external</emphasis> to the content items themselves, simplifying their
                    discovery and use.</para>
                
                <para>EPUB Publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents, nor do
                    they preclude linking in arbitrary ways — the Web is built on hypertext —
                    but the basic consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that
                    is not true for a set of HTML pages.</para>
                
            </section>
            
            <section xml:id="sec-nav-nav-doc">
                <title>Navigation Document</title>
                
                <para>Every EPUB Publication contains a special XHTML Content Document called the
                    <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/>, which uses the HTML5
                    <code>nav</code> element to define human- and machine-readable navigation
                    information.</para>
                
                <para>The Navigation Document supersedes the NCX document <xref linkend="refOPS2"/>,
                    and the inclusion of NCX documents is only recommended for forward compatibility in older 
                    Reading Systems. The Navigation Document, while maintaining the baseline accessibility and
                    navigation support and features of the NCX, introduces new functionality and rendering features
                    to enhance navigation for all Users. Prime among these are better support for internationalization —
                    as an XHTML5 document itself, the Navigation Document natively supports Ruby — and support for 
                    embedded grammars — MathML and SVG can be included within navigation links.</para>
                
                <para>As XHTML documents, 
                    Navigation Documents also provide a flexible means of tailoring the navigation display using CSS while
                    not impacting access to information for accessible Reading Systems.</para>
                
                <para>The structure and semantics of Navigation Documents are defined in <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="sec-xhtml-nav" type="epub-spec"/>.</para>
            </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-metadata">
            <title>Metadata</title>
            
            <para>EPUB Publications provide a rich array of options for adding Publication metadata. The 
                Package Document includes a dedicated <olink targetdoc="publications" 
                    targetptr="sec-metadata-elem" type="epub-spec">metadata section</olink> for general 
                information about the Publication, allowing titles, authors, identifiers and other information
                about the Publication to be easily accessed. It also provides the means to attach complete
                bibliographic records to a Publication (see <olink targetdoc="publications" 
                    targetptr="sec-link-elem" type="epub-spec"/>).</para>
            
            <para>The Package Document also allows a unique identifier to be established for a publication
                using the <olink targetdoc="publications" targetptr="attrdef-package-unique-identifier" 
                    type="epub-spec">unique-identifier attribute</olink>. This value identifies 
                the specific instance of a work contained in a Publication. The required modified date in the 
                Package metadata section can be joined with this identifier to define a <xref linkend="gloss-package-identifier"/>, or 
                means of identifying different versions of the same Publication (see <olink targetdoc="publications" 
                    targetptr="sec-package-metadata-identifiers" type="epub-spec"/>). The Package Identifier 
                addresses the issue of how to release a Publication without changing its unique identifier 
                while still identifying it as a new version.</para>
            
            <para>XHTML Content Documents also include the means of annotating document markup with
                rich metadata, making them more semantically meaningful and useful both for processing and accessibility
                purposes (<olink targetdoc="contentdocs" 
                    targetptr="sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection" type="epub-spec"/>).</para>

                readable content of a Publication and reference associated media resources (e.g.,
                images, audio and video clips).</para>
            
            <para><xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-xhtml"/>s are defined by a
                profile of HTML5 that requires the use of XML serialization <xref linkend="refHTML5"
                /> in order to ensure that content can be reliably manipulated and rendered. This
                profile also adds two additional EPUB-specific language constructs: the <olink
                    targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="attrdef-epub-type" type="epub-spec"/>

            <para>A key concept of EPUB is that content presentation should adapt to the
                User rather than the User having to adapt to a particular presentation of content. 
                HTML was originally designed to support dynamic rendering
                of structured content, but over time HTML as supported in Web browsers has become
                focused on the needs of Web applications, and most popular Web sites now have
                fixed-format layouts.</para>
            
            <para>EPUB Publications, however, are designed to maximize accessibility for
                the visually impaired, and Reading Systems typically
                perform text line layout and pagination on the fly, adapting to the size of the
                display area, the User's preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This
                behavior is not guaranteed in EPUB — images, vector graphics, video, and other
                content can be included, and such content may not be reflowable, and some Reading
                Systems may not do pagination on the fly, or at all — but supporting dynamic
                adaptive layout and accessibility has been a primary design consideration throughout
                the evolution of the EPUB standard.</para>
            
            <para>EPUB Content Documents can optionally reference <xref linkend="gloss-stylesheet"
            />s, allowing Authors to define the desired rendering properties. EPUB 3 defines a profile of CSS based
                on CSS 2.1 <xref linkend="refCSS21"/> for this purpose, together with capabilities
                defined by various CSS3 Modules and several additional properties specific to
                EPUB.</para>
            
            <para>The CSS3 properties that have been selected were done so based on their
                current level of support by Web browsers, but some properties may not affect rendering by
                Reading Systems and User Agents (support for the EPUB-defined properties may
                be similarly ineffectual).</para>
            
            <para>EPUB 3 also supports CSS styles that enable both horizontal and vertical layout and
                both left-to-right and right-to-left direction, but not all Reading Systems may
                support all of these capabilities. Reading Systems may also support different
                rendering options than the Author intended. Refer to <xref linkend="sec-gls-css"/>
                in the Global Language Support section for more information.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-fonts">
            <title>Fonts</title>

            <para>EPUB 3 supports two closely-related font formats — OpenType <xref
                linkend="refOpenType"/> and WOFF <xref linkend="refWOFF"/> — to accommodate 
                both traditional publishing
                workflows and emerging Web-based workflows. Word processing programs 
                used to create Publications are likely to have access only to a collection of installed 
                OpenType fonts, for example, while Web-archival EPUB generators will likely only have access to 
                WOFF resources (which cannot be converted to OpenType without undesirable, 
                and potentially unlicensed, stripping of WOFF metadata).</para>

            <para>EPUB 3 also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources for both OpenType
                and WOFF font formats. Support for obfuscated font resources is required to
                accommodate font licensing restrictions for many commercially-available
                fonts.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-scripting">
            <title>Scripting</title>
            
            <para>EPUB strives to treat content <emphasis
                role="italic">declaratively</emphasis> — as data that can be manipulated, not
                programs that must be executed — but does support scripting via JavaScript as 
                defined in <link linkend="refHTML5">HTML5</link> and <link linkend="refSVG"
                    >SVG</link> (refer to <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" 
                        targetptr="sec-scripted-content" type="epub-spec"/> for more information).</para>
            
            <para>It is important to note, however, that scripting support is
                optional for Reading Systems and may be disabled for security reasons. JavaScript 
                scripting in EPUB Content Documents also must not be executed by default and must be 
                explicitly requested as part of specifying a content document within a larger publication.</para>
            
            <para>Authors should also note that scripting in an EPUB publication can create security
                considerations that are different than scripting within a Web browser. For example,
                typical same origin policy restrictions are not applicable to content that has been
                downloaded to a User's local system. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that
                scripting be limited to container constrained contexts, as further described in
                    <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-scripted-content-content-reqs"
                    type="epub-spec"/>.</para>

            <para>Scripting consequently should be used only when essential to the User
                experience, as it greatly increases the likelihood that content will not be portable
                across all Reading Systems and creates barriers to accessibility and content
                reusability.</para>

            <para>The need to navigate a document is not exclusively an accessibility issue, but a complete

            <title>Dynamic Layouts</title>
            
            <para>The design center of EPUB is dynamic layout — content is typically intended to
                be formatted on the fly rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in
                advance (i.e. expecting a particular sized "page"). This core capability is useful, for 
                example, for optimizing rendering onto different sized device screens or window sizes, 
                and also facilitates and simplifies content
                accessibility vs. formats that are inherently final-form (such as bitmap page
                images and PDF). </para>
            
            <para>While it is possible to incorporate more highly formatted content in EPUB, for
                example via bitmap images or SVG graphics, or even use of CSS explicit
                positioning and/or table elements to achieve particular visual layouts, Authors
                are strongly discouraged from utilizing such techniques. They are not reliable
                in EPUB, since Reading Systems typically render content in a paginated manner
                rather than creating a single scrolling <xref linkend="gloss-viewport"/>, and
                the particular pagination algorithm used is Reading System dependent. If these
                techniques are required to convey the content of the publication (for example,
                for graphic novels), <olink targetdoc="publications"
                    targetptr="sec-fallback-processing-flow" type="epub-spec">fallbacks</olink>
                should always be included.</para>
            
            <para>In general, it is preferable to achieve visual richness by using <xref
                linkend="gloss-stylesheet"/>s without explicit sizing or positioning.</para>

            <title>Aural Renditions and Media Overlays</title>
            
            <para>Aural renditions of content are important for accessibility and are a
                desirable feature for many other Users. A baseline to facilitate aural rendering
                is to utilize semantic HTML designed for dynamic layout. Refer to <xref
                    linkend="sec-tts"/> for more information on how to use the native facilities
                that EPUB XHTML Documents include. </para>
            <para>One of the key new accessibility features in EPUB 3 is the inclusion of 
                <xref linkend="gloss-media-overlay-document"/>s <xref linkend="refOverlays3"/>.
                When pre-recorded narration is available for a Publication, Media Overlays provide the 
                ability to synchronize pre-recorded audio narration with the text of a Content Document, 
                a feature already familiar to readers of Digital Talking Books.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-fallbacks">
            <title>Fallbacks</title>
            <para>Not all formats are accessible in their native format, and not all Users may
                prefer to read in the default format provided. EPUB defines a variety of means
                for providing fallbacks so that alternate renditions of a Publication can be
                made available in these cases.</para>
            
            <para>Publication and content-level fallbacks are defined in <olink
                targetdoc="publications" targetptr="sec-fallback-processing-flow"
                type="epub-spec"/>. These allow for the alternate rendition of specific
                resources within a Publication, such as SVG images or video clips.</para>
            <para>In addition, multiple instances of a complete work can be delivered in a
                single Publication by defining multiple <code>rootfile</code> elements in the
                OCF container file (as described in <olink targetdoc="ocf"
                    targetptr="sec-container-metainf-container.xml" type="epub-spec"/>). This
                kind of fallback may be used, for example, so that a formatted graphic novel
                defined via a sequence of SVG pages can be accompanied by an accessible text
                version defined via XHTML.</para>

            <para>EPUB 3 adopts a progressive enhancement technique for scripted
                content, whereby scripting, and specifically the lack of, must not interfere 
                with the integrity of the document (i.e., must not result in information loss
                when scripting is not available). Documents that do employ scripting are

                        textual elements to act as controls for audio and video playback (for
                        example, to start, stop and pause playback). This element eliminates the
                        common use of scripting to include similar functionality.</para>

                        other custom content types, as well as future-proofs Publications in
                        case such content types are natively supported in future Reading

                        hints to Reading Systems about content properties. One use case is to define
                        elements such as images and video as having a zoomable property value, in
                        which case a Reading System may provide a means for Users to access an
                        expanded view that is out-of-line with the normal layout. Such rollover
                        effects are typically implemented via scripting in Web contexts, but
                        scripting cannot be readily implemented given the wide variety of layouts
                        that a Reading System may generate.</para>
