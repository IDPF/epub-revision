            <title>EPUB 3 Overview</title>
            <para>EPUB 3 is the third major revision of an interchange and delivery format for
                digital publications based on XML and Web Standards. EPUB 3 is defined by a set of
                specification documents, including this document. This document serves as the
                overall introduction to EPUB 3, describing the other EPUB 3 documents and reviewing
                cross-cutting concerns including accessibility, metadata, and global language
                support.</para>

            <title>Overview</title>

            <para>The EPUB® specification is a distribution and interchange format standard for
                digital publications and documents. EPUB defines a means of representing, packaging
                and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including HTML5,
                CSS, SVG and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
                format.</para>

            <para xml:id="sibling-specs">EPUB 3, the third major release of the standard, consists
                of a set of four specifications, each defining an important component of an overall
                    <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/>:</para>

            <itemizedlist xml:id="epub-specs-listing">
                <xi:include href="./share/specdesc-publications.xml"/>
                <xi:include href="./share/specdesc-contentdocs.xml"/>
                <xi:include href="./share/specdesc-ocf.xml"/>
                <xi:include href="./share/specdesc-overlays.xml"/>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>EPUB has been widely adopted as the format for digital books (eBooks), and these
                new specifications significantly increase the format's capabilities in order to
                better support a wider range of publication requirements, including complex layouts,
                rich media and interactivity, and global typography features. The expectation is
                that EPUB 3 will be utilized for a broad range of content, including books,
                magazines and educational, professional and scientific publications.</para>

            <para>This document provides a starting point for content authors and software
                developers wishing to understand these specifications. It consists entirely of informative
                overview material, including a <link linkend="sec-intro-roadmap">roadmap</link> to
                the four building-block specification documents that compose EPUB 3.</para>

            <para>Another informative document, EPUB 3 Changes from EPUB 2.0.1 <xref
                    linkend="refEPUB3Changes"/>, describes changes in EPUB 3 from the previous
                version, but is intended primarily for <xref linkend="gloss-author"/>s and <xref
                    linkend="gloss-epub-reading-system"/> vendors migrating from EPUB 2.0.1 to EPUB
                3 and for those who anticipate supporting both versions.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-intro-roadmap">
            <title>Roadmap</title>

            <para>This section provides an overview of the EPUB 3 specifications by explaining in
                brief the components of an <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/>. Links to additional 
                information within this document and to the specifications are included.</para>

            <para>An EPUB Publication, at its most basic level, is a bundled
                collection of resources that can be reliably and predictably ingested by an <xref
                    linkend="gloss-epub-reading-system"/> in order to render its contents to a <xref
                    linkend="gloss-user"/>. Each EPUB Publication consists of one or renderings of its
                content, called <xref linkend="gloss-rendition"/>s.</para>
            
            <para>Some of the resources in the EPUB Container facilitate the discovery and
                processing of the Renditions, while others make up the content of the source
                publication. The latter, <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub"/>s, are
                described in <xref linkend="sec-content-docs"/> and are fully defined in <xref
                    linkend="refContentDocs3"/>.</para>

            <para>An EPUB Publication's resources are typically bundled for distribution as a ZIP-based
                archive with the file extension <filename>.epub</filename>. As conformant ZIP
                archives, EPUB Publications can be unzipped by many software programs, simplifying both
                their production and consumption. The container format is introduced in <xref
                    linkend="sec-container"/> and defined in <xref linkend="refOCF3"/>.</para>

            <para>The container format not only provides a means of determining that the zipped
                content represents an EPUB Publication (the <filename>mimetype</filename> file), but
                also provides a universally-named directory of informative resources
                    (<filename>/META-INF</filename>). Key among these is the
                    <filename>container.xml</filename> file, which directs Reading Systems to the
                root files of the available Renditions of the EPUB Publication (their 
                <xref linkend="gloss-package-document"/>s).</para>

            <para>The Package Document is itself a kind of centralized information source for
                a given Rendition, storing metadata about the specific work expressed by the Rendition,
                providing an exhaustive list of resources and defining a default reading order. The
                Package Document is introduced in <xref linkend="sec-package-file"/> and defined in
                    <xref linkend="refPublications3"/>.</para>

            <para>The preceding components of an EPUB Publication are not new to EPUB 3, and will be
                familiar to anyone who has worked with EPUB Publications before, although they have been
                changed and enhanced in this version. A new core addition to EPUB 3, however, is the
                    <xref linkend="gloss-media-overlay-document"/>, which defines a means of
                synchronizing text and audio playback for a given Rendition. The Overlay Document is introduced in <xref
                    linkend="sec-multimedia"/> and defined in <xref linkend="refOverlays3"/>.</para>

            <para>The following example shows the resources a minimal single-Rendition "Hello World" 
                EPUB Publication might contain:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis>
mimetype
META-INF/container.xml
Content/HelloWorld.opf
Content/HelloWorld.xhtml
</synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>While conceptually simple, an EPUB Publication is more than just a collection of
                HTML pages and dependent assets in a ZIP package as represented in this example. The
                following sections of this document delve into more detail about the primary
                features and functionality that EPUB Publications provide to enhance the reading
                experience.</para>

        </section>

    </chapter>

    <chapter xml:id="sec-features">
        <title>Features</title>

        <para>This section covers the major features of EPUB, including important components and
            topics that apply to the process of authoring <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/>s
            as a whole.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-package-file">
            <title>Package Document</title>

            <para>Each <xref linkend="gloss-rendition"/> of an EPUB Publication includes a single 
                <xref linkend="gloss-package-document"/>,
                which specifies all the resources required to render that Rendition. The Package 
                Document also defines a reading order for linear consumption, and associates
                metadata and navigation information for the Rendition.</para>

            <para>The Package Document represents a significant improvement on a typical Web site. A
                Web site, for example, embeds references to its resources within its content, which,
                while a simple and flexible means of identifying resources, makes it difficult to
                enumerate all the resources required to render it. In addition, there is no standard
                way for a Web site to define that a sequence of pages make up a larger publication,
                which is precisely what EPUB's <markup><olink targetdoc="publications" targetptr="sec-spine-elem"
                    type="epub-spec">spine</olink></markup> element does (i.e., it provides an
                external declarative means to explicitly specify navigation through a collection of
                documents). Finally, the Package Document defines a standard way to represent
                metadata globally applicable to a collection of pages.</para>
            
            <para>The Package Document also includes a <markup><olink targetdoc="publications" 
                targetptr="sec-collection-elem" type="epub-spec">collection</olink></markup> element, which
                allows grouping of logically-related <xref linkend="gloss-publication-resource-cmt-or-foreign"/>s.
                This element exists to enable the development of specialized content identification, processing
                and rendering features, such as the ability to define embedded preview content, or assemble an index
                or dictionary from its constituent XHTML Content Documents.</para>

            <para>The Package Document and other Rendition-specific constructs are specified in <xref
                    linkend="refPublications3"/>.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-nav">
            <title>Navigation</title>

            <section xml:id="sec-nav-order">
                <title>Reading Order</title>

                <para>A key concept of EPUB is that an EPUB Publication consists of multiple resources
                    that can be completely navigated and consumed by a person or program <emphasis
                        role="italic">in some specific order</emphasis>.</para>

                <para>Many types of publication have an obvious reading order, or logical progression
                    through their content. A novel is an example of a highly sequential document —
                    it typically has a beginning, middle and end — but not all publications are so
                    ordered: a cookbook or collection of photographic images might be considered to
                    be more like a database. All documents do, however, have at least one logical
                    ordering of all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic, location
                    or some other criteria (e.g., a cookbook is typically ordered by type of
                    recipe).</para>

                <para>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its
                    top-level content (the <olink targetdoc="publications"
                        targetptr="sec-spine-elem" type="epub-spec"/>), as well as a declarative
                    table of contents (the <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/>
                    <xref linkend="refContentDocs3"/>). EPUB Publications make these data structures
                    available in a machine-readable way <emphasis role="italic">external</emphasis>
                    to the content, simplifying their discovery and use.</para>

                <para>EPUB Publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents,
                    nor do they preclude linking in arbitrary ways — just like the Web, EPUB
                    Publications are built on hypertext — but the basic consumption and navigation
                    can be reliably accomplished in a way that is not true for a set of HTML
                    pages.</para>

            </section>

            <section xml:id="sec-nav-nav-doc">
                <title>Navigation Document</title>

                <para>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication contains a special XHTML Content Document called the
                        <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/>, which uses the HTML5
                        <markup>nav</markup> element to define human- and machine-readable navigation
                    information.</para>

                <para>The Navigation Document supersedes the NCX document <xref linkend="refOPS2"/>,
                    and the inclusion of NCX documents is only recommended for forward compatibility
                    in older Reading Systems. The Navigation Document, while maintaining the
                    baseline accessibility and navigation support and features of the NCX,
                    introduces new functionality and rendering features to enhance navigation for
                    all Users. Prime among these are better support for internationalization (as an
                    XHTML5 document itself, the Navigation Document natively supports ruby
                    annotations) and support for embedded grammars (MathML and SVG can be included
                    within navigation links).</para>

                <para>As XHTML Content Documents, Navigation Documents also provide a flexible means
                    of tailoring the navigation display using CSS and the <olink
                        targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-nav-def-hidden"
                        type="epub-spec">hidden attribute</olink> while not impacting access to
                    information for accessible Reading Systems.</para>

                <para>The structure and semantics of Navigation Documents are defined in <olink
                        targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-nav" type="epub-spec"/>.</para>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-linking">
            <title>Linking</title>

            <para>The new EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifier (epubcfi) Specification <xref
                    linkend="refEPUBCFI"/> defines a standardized method for linking into an
                EPUB Publication. </para>

            <para>Required support for this scheme in Reading Systems means that EPUB now has an
                interoperable linking mechanism, one that can, for example, facilitate the sharing
                of bookmarks and reading locations across devices.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-metadata">
            <title>Metadata</title>

            <para>EPUB Publications provide a rich array of options for adding metadata.
                Each Rendition's Package Document includes a dedicated <olink targetdoc="publications"

            <para>The Package Document also allows a <xref linkend="gloss-unique-identifier"/> to be

                section can be joined with this identifier to define a <xref

            	different versions of an EPUB Publication (see <olink targetdoc="publications"
                    targetptr="sec-package-metadata-identifiers" type="epub-spec"/>). The Package
                Identifier addresses the issue of how to release an EPUB Publication without changing its
                Unique Identifier while still identifying it as a new version.</para>

            <para>XHTML Content Documents also include the means of annotating document markup with

        <section xml:id="sec-rendering">
            <title>Rendering and CSS</title>

            <para>A key concept of EPUB is that content presentation adapts to the User, rather
                than the User having to adapt to a particular presentation of content. HTML was
                originally designed to support dynamic rendering of structured content, but over
                time HTML as supported in Web browsers has become focused on the needs of Web
                applications, and most popular Web sites now have fixed-format layouts.</para>

            <para>EPUB Publications, however, are designed to maximize accessibility for the
                visually impaired, and Reading Systems typically perform text line layout and
                pagination on the fly, adapting to the size of the display area, the User's
                preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This behavior is not
                guaranteed in EPUB; images, vector graphics, video and other non-reflowable content
                might be included, and some Reading Systems might not paginate on the fly, or at all.
                Nevertheless, supporting dynamic adaptive layout and accessibility has been a
                primary design consideration throughout the evolution of the EPUB standard.</para>

            <para>EPUB Content Documents can reference <xref linkend="gloss-stylesheet"
                />s, allowing Authors to define the desired rendering properties. EPUB 3 defines a
                profile of CSS based on CSS 2.1 <xref linkend="refCSS21"/> for this purpose,
                together with capabilities defined by various CSS3 Modules and several additional
                properties specific to EPUB.</para>

            <para>CSS3 properties were selected based on their current level of support in Web
                browsers, but support for them in Reading Systems and User Agents is not guaranteed
                (EPUB-defined properties can similarly be ignored).</para>

            <para>EPUB 3 also supports CSS styles that enable both horizontal and vertical layout
                and both left-to-right and right-to-left writing, but Reading Systems might not
                support all of these capabilities. Reading Systems might also support different
                rendering options than the Author intended. Refer to <xref linkend="sec-gls-css"/>
                in the Global Language Support section for more information.</para>

            <para>EPUB 3 also supports the ability to include multiple style sheets that allow
                users, for example, to select between day/night reading modes or to change the
                rendering direction of the text. Refer to <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"

            <para>EPUB 3 supports audio and video embedded in <xref linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-xhtml"/>
                via the new <xref linkend="refHTML5"/>
                <markup>audio</markup> and <markup>video</markup> elements, inheriting all the functionality

                pre-recorded narration is available for a Rendition of an EPUB Publication, Media Overlays provide the
                ability to synchronize that audio with the text of a Content Document (see also

        <section xml:id="sec-fonts">
            <title>Fonts</title>

            <para>EPUB 3 supports two closely-related font formats — OpenType <xref
                    linkend="refOpenType"/> and WOFF <xref linkend="refWOFF"/> — to accommodate both
                traditional publishing workflows and emerging Web-based workflows. Word processing
                programs used to create EPUB Publications are likely to have access only to a collection
                of installed OpenType fonts, for example, whereas Web-archival EPUB generators will
                likely only have access to WOFF resources (which cannot be converted to OpenType
                without undesirable, and potentially unlicensed, stripping of WOFF metadata).</para>

            <para>EPUB 3 also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources for both OpenType
                and WOFF font formats. Support for obfuscated font resources is required to
                accommodate font licensing restrictions for many commercially-available
                fonts.</para>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-scripting">
            <title>Scripting</title>

            <para>EPUB strives to treat content <emphasis role="italic">declaratively</emphasis> —
                as data that can be manipulated, not programs to be executed — but does
                support scripting as defined in <link linkend="refHTML5">HTML5</link> and <link
                    linkend="refSVG">SVG</link> (refer to <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="sec-scripted-content" type="epub-spec"/> for more
                information).</para>

            <para>It is important to note, however, that scripting support is optional for Reading
                Systems and might be disabled for security reasons.</para>

            <para>Authors need to be aware that scripting in an EPUB Publication can create security
                considerations that are different from scripting within a Web browser. For example,
                typical same-origin policies are not applicable to content that has been downloaded
                to a User's local system. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that scripting be
                limited to container constrained contexts, as further described in <olink
                    targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-scripted-content-content-reqs"
                    type="epub-spec"/>.</para>

            <para>In other words, consider limiting scripting to cases where it is essential to the User experience,
                since it greatly increases the likelihood that content will not be portable across
                all Reading Systems and creates barriers to accessibility and content
                reusability.</para>

            <title>Fonts</title>

            <para>EPUB 3 does not require that Reading Systems come with any particular set of
                built-in system fonts. As occurs in Web contexts, Users in a particular locale might
                have installed fonts that omit characters required for other locales, and Reading
                Systems might utilize intrinsic fonts or font engines that do not utilize operating
                system installed fonts. As a result, the text content of an EPUB Publication might not
                natively render as intended on all Reading Systems.</para>

            <para>To address this problem, EPUB 3 supports the embedding of fonts to facilitate the
                rendering of text content, and this practice is recommended in order to ensure
                content is rendered as intended.</para>

            <para>Support for embedded fonts also ensures that characters and
                glyphs unique to an EPUB Publication can be embedded for proper display.</para>

            <para>EPUB 3's support for PLS documents and SSML attributes increases the pronunciation
                control that Authors have over the rendering of any natural language in

    <chapter xml:id="sec-accessibility">
        <title>Accessibility</title>

        <para>A major goal of EPUB is to facilitate content accessibility, and a variety of features
            in EPUB 3 support this requirement. This section reviews these features, detailing some
            established best practices for ensuring that EPUB Publications are accessible where
            applicable.</para>

        <para>It is important to note that while accessibility is important in its own right,
            accessible content is also more valuable content: an accessible EPUB Publication will be
            adaptable to more devices and be easier to reuse, in whole or in part, via human and
            automated workflows. The EPUB Working Group strongly recommends that Authors 
            ensure that they generate accessible content.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-nav">
            <title>Navigation</title>

            <para>EPUB 3 improves on NCX documents with the addition of <xref
                    linkend="gloss-content-document-epub-nav"/>s. As noted in <xref
                    linkend="sec-nav-nav-doc"/> above, the new navigation features represent a
                more universal and flexible navigation system.</para>

            <para>Navigation by table of contents is not exclusively an accessibility issue, but a
                complete table of contents ensures all Users can easily and fully access the contents 
                of an EPUB Publication. The primary <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="sec-xhtml-nav-def-types-toc" type="epub-spec">toc nav element</olink>
                has to fully reflect the structure of the EPUB Publication to provide this functionality,
                otherwise navigation gets compromised for some Users.</para>

            <para>The Navigation Document can also be reused in the body of an EPUB Publication by
                including it in the <markup>spine</markup>. To avoid the situation in highly structured 
                documents where it might not be desirable to display the complete table of contents to Users
                in the body, the display level can be modified using the <xref linkend="refHTML5"/>
                <property>hidden</property> attribute. This attribute is ignored by Reading Systems
                when they render the table of contents outside the <markup>spine</markup> (e.g., in their
                own specialized views), which avoids minimizing the information that is available.</para>

            <para>Authors are also encouraged to supply additional <markup>nav</markup> elements if
                their EPUB Publications contain non-structural points of interest, such as figures,
                tables, etc. in order to further enhance access to the content.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-semantic-markup">
            <title>Semantic Markup</title>
            <para>HTML5 supports a number of new elements intended to make markup more semantically
                meaningful (e.g., <markup>section</markup>, <markup>nav</markup> and <markup>aside</markup>) and
                introduces more clearly defined semantics for some HTML4 elements. Make use of these elements,
                in conjunction with best practices for authoring well-structured Web content, when 
                creating EPUB XHTML Content Documents. These additions allow
                content to be better grouped and defined, both for representing the structure of
                documents and to facilitate their logical navigation. XHTML Content Documents also
                natively support the inclusion of ARIA role and state attributes and events,
                enhancing the ability of Assistive Technologies to interact with the content.</para>
            <para>EPUB 3 further introduces the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="attrdef-epub-type" type="epub-spec"/> attribute, which is meant to be
                functionally equivalent to the W3C Role Attribute <xref linkend="refPFRoleAttribute"
                />. This attribute allows any element in an XHTML Content Document to include
                additional information about its purpose and meaning within the work, using
                controlled vocabularies and terms. Refer to <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection" type="epub-spec"/> for more
                information.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-layout">
            <title>Dynamic Layouts</title>

            <para>The design center of EPUB is dynamic layout: content is typically intended to be
                formatted on the fly rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in advance
                (i.e., expecting a particular sized "page"). This core capability is useful, for
                example, for optimizing rendering onto different sized device screens or window
                sizes, and it facilitates and simplifies content accessibility. </para>

            <para>While it is possible to incorporate more highly formatted content in EPUB — for
                example via bitmap images or SVG graphics, or even use of CSS explicit positioning
                and/or table elements to achieve particular visual layouts — Authors are strongly
                discouraged from utilizing such techniques. They are not reliable in EPUB since many
                Reading Systems render content in a paginated manner rather than creating a single
                scrolling <xref linkend="gloss-viewport"/> and since each Reading System might define
                its own pagination algorithm. If these techniques are necessary to convey the content
                of the publication, consider including <olink
                    targetdoc="publications" targetptr="sec-fallback-processing-flow"
                    type="epub-spec">fallbacks</olink> (e.g., for graphic novels).</para>

            <para>In general, it is preferable to achieve visual richness by using <xref
                    linkend="gloss-stylesheet"/>s without absolute sizing or positioning.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-aria-describedat">
            <title>Content Descriptions</title>
            
            <para>Although descriptions are commonly associated with image-based content, the ability
                to describe any complex structure in a document is a necessary requirement to make the 
                content more accessible. Describing complex tabular data can be beneficial to all readers,
                for example.</para>
            
            <para>EPUB 3 includes two mechanisms for attaching descriptions to structures in XHTML Content
                Documents. The <xref linkend="refARIA"/> <markup>aria-describedby</markup> attribute was 
                allows enables linking to descriptions within the same page, and the <xref linkend="refARIA11"/>
                <markup>aria-describedat</markup> attribute can be used to reference descriptions in another
                file (which can be located inside or outside the EPUB Container).</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-overlays">
            <title>Aural Renditions and Media Overlays</title>

            <para>Aural renderings of content are important for accessibility and are a desirable
                feature for many other Users. A baseline to facilitate aural rendering is to utilize
                semantic HTML designed for dynamic layout. Refer to <xref linkend="sec-tts"/> for
                more information on how to use the native facilities that EPUB XHTML Documents
                include. </para>

            <para>Media Overlays provide the ability to synchronize the text and audio content of an
                EPUB Publication, a feature already familiar to readers of DAISY Digital Talking Books.
                Overlays transcend the accessibility domain in their usefulness: the synchronization
                of text and audio as a tool for learning to read, for example, being of benefit in
                many circumstances. </para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-fallbacks">
            <title>Fallbacks</title>
            <para>Not all formats are accessible in their native format, and not all Users prefer to
                read in the default format provided. EPUB defines a variety of means for providing
                fallbacks so that alternate renderings can be made available in
                these cases.</para>

             <para>Publication- and content-level fallbacks are defined in <olink
        		targetdoc="publications" targetptr="sec-fallback-processing-flow"
        		type="epub-spec"/>. These fallback mechanisms enable the inclusion of Foreign Resources in 
             	an EPUB Publication and ensure compatibility of EPUB 3 content across Reading Systems with 
             	varying capabilities (e.g., they allow the inclusion of multiple video formats, and the inclusion of 
             	XHTML fallbacks to SVG Content Documents for EPUB 2 Reading Systems).</para>
        	     <para>The <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-epub-switch" type="epub-spec">switch 
        		element</olink> similarly provides fallback capabilities for markup-level content features that might 
        		not be supported in some Reading Systems (e.g., to enable the inclusion of ChemML in EPUB 3 
        		Reading Systems, or to provide an alternative to MathML for EPUB 2 Reading Systems).</para>
            <para>In addition, multiple instances of a complete work can be delivered in a single
                EPUB Publication by defining multiple <markup>rootfile</markup> elements in the OCF container
                file (as described in <olink targetdoc="ocf"
                    targetptr="sec-container-metainf-container.xml" type="epub-spec"/>). These alternate
                Rendition fallbacks might be used, for example, so that a formatted graphic novel defined via
                a sequence of SVG pages can be accompanied by an accessible text version defined via
                XHTML.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-scripting">
            <title>Scripting</title>

            <para>EPUB 3 adopts a progressive enhancement approach for scripted content, whereby
                scripting has to not interfere with the integrity of the document (i.e., not
                result in information loss when scripting is not available). Consequently, although
                documents that do employ scripting <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="sec-scripted-content" type="epub-spec">can provide fallbacks</olink>
                to further facilitate access to their contents, the documents have to be accessible
                without them.</para>

            <para>Several mechanisms in EPUB can further minimize and constrain scripting within

                        start, stop and pause playback). This element eliminates the common use of
                        scripting to include similar functionality.</para>

                        expanded view that is out-of-line with the normal layout. Such rollover
                        effects are typically implemented via scripting in Web contexts, but
                        scripting cannot be readily implemented given the wide variety of layouts
