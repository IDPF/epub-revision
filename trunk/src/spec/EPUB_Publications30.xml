        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>EPUB is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and
            Web Standards. An EPUB Publication can be thought of as a a reliable  packaging of Web
            content that represents a digital book, magazine, or other type of publication, with a
            declarative means to navigate through the content, and able to distributed reliably for
            online and offline consumption. </para>
        <para>This specification defines the semantics and conformance requirements for EPUB at the
            publication level. The individual contents of EPUB Publications are defined by other
            specifications; a fully-packaged EPUB Publication consists of at minimum four files
            (e.g., <filename>container.xml</filename>, <filename>manifest.opf</filename>,
                <filename>nav.ncx</filename>, and <filename>content.xhtml</filename>), defined
            according to the rules of this and other specifications (including <xref
                linkend="refOCF3"/>, and
            <xref   linkend="refContentDocs3"/>). This specification defines the formats of the OPF and NCX files, as
            well as additional rules for how these files and other optional files are tied together
            to create valid and conforming EPUB Publications, and for how such Publications are
            processed by a conforming Reading System.</para>
