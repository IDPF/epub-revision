            <title>EPUB Revision History</title>
            <para>EPUB had its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure (OEBPS). 
            OEBPS 1.0 was approved by the organization that became the International Digital Publishing
            Forum (IDPF) in 1999. Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the IDPF in 2001 and 2002 respectively.</para>
<para>            It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery
as well as interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS, which 
was approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS began in parallel which was approved 
as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007, consisting of a triumvirate of specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF)
together with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a minor update to the 2.0 specification set primarily intended to address issues with the specifications, was approved in September, 2010.

            <para>Initial steps were taken in the EPUB 2 specifications to make each individual
                specification modular and able to be reused by other applications besides EPUB.
                EPUB3 attempts to further increase modularity by always being clear when a
                sub-specification is stating a conformance requirement that is specific to its use
                by EPUB, rather than being applicable to any conceivable use of the constructs
                defined by that sub-specification.</para>

        <para>EPUB Content Documents 3.0 supersedes Open Publication Structure 2.0.1 (OPS2).
            However, this EPUB3 specification is drastically different than its predecessor more so
            than the other two of the "triumvirate" of specifications that comprised EPUB 2.0.1. A
            major reason for this difference is that EPUB Content Documents 3.0 uses XHTML5 and CSS
            2.1 plus select CSS3 properties, whereas OPS2 was based on an explicitly defined subset
            of XHTML 1.1 profiles and selected style sheet properties from CSS 2. Additional
            differences derive from new optional constructs and style properties defined in, and
            from constructs present in OPS2 that are removed from, EPUB Content Documents
            3.0.</para>

                <para>DAISY DTBook was an alternative syntax to XHTML 1.1 for Content Documents in
                    OPS 2.0.1, in order to provide an option for  more semantic, and thus more
                    accessible, content. As XHTML5 includes intrinsic semantic markup capabilities
                    of a similar nature to DTBook, DTBook is no longer an alternative syntax in
                    EPUB3. <remark role="todo">TODO - more precise ref. to DTBook etc.

            <para>OPF 2.0.1. specified an optional extension mechanism enabling a spine item to be
                "custom module" XHTML or arbitrary XML styled with CSS. This feature was not widely
                adopted by content or Reading Systems, and has been removed from EPUB3, which also
                defines  a more powerful script-based extensibility mechanism. As a result the
                    <code>&lt;item></code> element no longer has an optional
