<p class="lead">This <em>example</em> illustrates a way to implement
<em>region-specific</em> styles. It is needed when styling
of the content is associated with the <em>placement</em> of that content in a particular region, <em>not 
with the content itself</em>. For instance, in this particular example, content which falls into
the top region will have <em>larger</em> font size. Try resizing the browser window: you will see that
as words flow from the top region to the regular body region, their <em>styling</em> changes.</p>
