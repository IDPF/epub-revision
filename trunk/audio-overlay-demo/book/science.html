			<p id="id35800426"><span id="id35800427">There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty years
 ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of all, which
 has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.</span> <span id="id35800432">Already, at the
 beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of electricity,"
 yet there were few things in nature about which we knew less. </span><span id="id35800435">The
 "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our rooms,
 but none knew what the current was. </span><span id="id35800438">There was a vague idea that it was a sort
 of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in a pipe. </span><span id="id35800442">We now
 suppose that it is <emph>a rapid movement of electrons from atom to atom</emph> in
 the wire or wherever the current is.</span></p>
			<p id="id35800449"><span id="id35800450">Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about us.</span><span id="id35800454">
 As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive electricity
 which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of negative
 electricity.</span><sup id="FNanchor_4_4"><a href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a></sup> <span id="id35800469" role="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span> <span id="id35800474">This certainly tells us to some
 extent what electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us
 with the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. </span><span id="id35800478">But we now know that
 electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of electricity is
 made up of a number of small units or charges of a definite, constant amount.</span><span id="id35800482">
 It has been suggested that the two kinds of electricity, i.e. positive and
 negative, are right-handed and left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether,
 or rings in ether, but there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this
 to the future.</span></p>

  "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the days

  called positive; an undercharged body was called negative. </span><span id="id35800503">A
  positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some of their
  outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of electricity predominates.</span><span id="id35800506">

				<h1 id="id35800516">What an Electric Current is</h1>
			</header>
			<p id="id35800521"><span id="id35800522">The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. </span><span id="id35800525">The outlying
 electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on a large scale,
 is the meaning of the electric current. </span><span id="id35800529">In other words, we believe an
 electric current to be a flow of electrons. </span><span id="id35800532">Let us take, to begin with, a
 simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is generated:
 such a cell as there is in every house to serve its electric bells.</span></p>
			<p id="id35800536"><span id="id35800537">In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of
 a plate of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. </span><span id="id35800540">Long before
 anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc and
 copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. </span><span id="id35800544">We know now what
 this means.</span><span id="id35800546"> Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly disposed to
 part with some of their outlying electrons. </span><span id="id35800549">Why, we do not know; but the fact
 is the basis of these small batteries. </span><span id="id35800552">Electrons from the atoms of zinc pass
 to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a "current." </span><span id="id35800555">Each atom
 gives up an electron to its neighbour.</span><span id="id35800558"> It was further found long ago that if
 the zinc and copper were immersed in certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve
 the zinc, and the two metals were connected by a copper wire, the current was
 stronger.</span><span id="id35800562"> In modern language, there is a brisker flow of electrons.</span><span id="id35800564" role="pagenum"> [Pg 271] </span><span id="id35800571"> The
 reason is that the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more electrons
 to pass on to the copper.</span></p>

   Uranium X. </span><span id="id35800602">This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium.</span><span id="id35800605">
   Radium passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram,
   and finally becomes lead. </span><span id="id35800608">Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
   faster than others.</span><span id="id35800611"> Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking 5,000,000,000
   years to reach the same stage of disintegration that Radium A reaches in 3
   minutes. </span><span id="id35800615">As the disintegration proceeds, the substances become of lighter
   and lighter atomic weights. </span><span id="id35800618">Thus Uranium has an atomic weight of 238,
   whereas lead has an atomic weight of only 206. </span><span id="id35800621">The breaking down of atoms
   is fully explained in the text.</span></p>
			</aside>
			
			<p id="id35800626"><span id="id35800627">Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac, but
 the principle is the same. </span><span id="id35800630">The flow of electricity is a flow of electrons;
 though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as molecules of
 water do. </span><span id="id35800633">You may have seen boys place a row of bricks, each standing on one
 end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed, will knock over the
 second, the second the third, and so on to the last. </span><span id="id35800637">There is a flow of
 <emph>movement</emph> all along the line, but each brick moves only a short
 distance. </span><span id="id35800643">So an electron merely passes to the next atom, which sends on an
 electron to a third atom, and so on. </span><span id="id35800646">In this case, however, the movement from
 atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of movement, if we may call it so,
 may pass along at an enormous speed. </span><span id="id35800650">We have seen how swiftly electrons
 travel.</span></p>	
			<p id="id35800654"><span id="id35800655">But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is turned
 into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical section later
 in this work. </span><span id="id35800659">We are concerned here only with the principle, which is clear.
 While zinc is very apt to part with electrons, copper is just as obliging in
 facilitating their passage onward. </span><span id="id35800663">Electrons will travel in this way in most
 metals, but copper is one of the best "conductors." </span><span id="id35800666">So we lengthen
 the copper wire between the zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the
 front door and the bell, which are included in the circuit. </span><span id="id35800669">When you press
 the button at the door, two wires are brought together, and the current of
 electrons rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted
 into the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.</span></p>
			<p id="id35800674"><span id="id35800675">Copper is a good conductor  - six times as good as iron  -  and is
 therefore so common in electrical industries. </span><span id="id35800679">Some other substances are just
 as stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators,"
 because they resist the current instead of letting it flow.</span><span id="id35800682" role="pagenum"> [Pg 272] </span><span id="id35800689">Their
 atoms do not easily part with electrons. </span><span id="id35800691">Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are
 very good insulators for this reason.</span></p>

				<h1 id="id35800701">What the Dynamo does</h1>
			</header>
			<p id="id35800705"><span id="id35800706">But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. </span><span id="id35800710">As the
 invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a magnetic
 field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the surrounding ether.</span><span id="id35800713">
 To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the wire that the energy
 originated by the electrons is transmitted. </span><span id="id35800716">To set electrons moving on a
 large scale we use a "dynamo." </span><span id="id35800719">By means of the dynamo it is
 possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical energy. </span><span id="id35800722">The modern
 dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked upon as an electron pump.</span><span id="id35800725">
 We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we would only say that a large
 coil of copper wire is caused to turn round rapidly between the poles of a
 powerful magnet. </span><span id="id35800728">That is the essential construction of the
 "dynamo," which is used for generating strong currents. </span><span id="id35800732">We shall
 see in a moment how magnetism differs from electricity, and will say here
 only that round the poles of a large magnet there is a field of intense
 disturbance which will start a flow of electrons in any copper that is
 introduced into it. </span><span id="id35800736">On account of the speed given to the coil of wire its
 atoms enter suddenly this magnetic field, and they give off crowds of
 electrons in a flash.</span></p>
			<p id="id35800740"><span id="id35800741">It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 the <emph>opposite</emph> direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 field.</span><span id="id35800748"> And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful current of
 electricity that runs in alternate directions  -  an
 "alternating" current. </span><span id="id35800752">Electricians have apparatus for converting
 it into a continuous current where this is necessary.</span></p>
			<p id="id35800756"><span id="id35800757">A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 atom. </span><span id="id35800760">Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and explosively
 from one body to another, </span> <span id="id35800762" role="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span> <span id="id35800767">as in the electric spark or the occasional flash
 from an electric tram or train. </span><span id="id35800771">The grandest and most spectacular display of
 this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. </span><span id="id35800774">As we saw earlier, a portentous furnace
 like the sun is constantly pouring floods of electrons from its atoms into
 space. </span><span id="id35800777">The earth intercepts great numbers of these electrons.</span><span id="id35800780"> In the upper
 regions of the air the stream of solar electrons has the effect of separating
 positively-electrified atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the
 water-vapour, which is constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers
 more freely round the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as
 rain, to the earth. </span><span id="id35800785">Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive
 electricity, or becomes "negatively electrified." </span><span id="id35800788">In the
 thunderstorm we get both kinds of clouds  - some with large excesses of
 electrons, and some deficient in electrons  - and the tension grows until
 at last it is relieved by a sudden and violent discharge of electrons from
 one cloud to another or to the earth  - an electric spark on a prodigious
 scale.</span></p>

			<p id="id35800847"><span id="id35800848">We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. </span><span id="id35800851">Now
 an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. </span><span id="id35800854">The surrounding space is
 endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy.</span><span id="id35800857"> A piece of
 magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular idea of
 a magnet. </span><span id="id35800860">If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a piece of
 cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we shall find that,
 on passing an electric current through the wire, the iron filings arrange
 themselves in circles round it.</span><span id="id35800864"> The magnetic force, due to the electric
 current, seems to exist in circles round the wire, an ether disturbance being
 set up. </span><span id="id35800867">Even a single electron, when in movement, creates a magnetic
 "field," as it is called, round its path. </span><span id="id35800870">There is no movement of
 electrons without this attendant field of energy, </span><span id="id35800873" role="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span> </span><span id="id35800878">and their motion is
 not stopped until that field of energy disappears from the ether. </span><span id="id35800881">The modern
 theory of magnetism supposes that all magnetism is produced in this way. </span><span id="id35800884">All
 magnetism is supposed to arise from the small whirling motions of the
 electrons contained in the ultimate atoms of matter. </span><span id="id35800887">We cannot here go into
 the details of the theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so
 differently from other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here,
 also, the electron theory provides the key. </span><span id="id35800891">This theory is not yet definitely
 <emph>proved</emph>, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 research. </span><span id="id35800897">The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. </span><span id="id35800901">Now it has
 been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons and that
 it exerts a strong magnetic action. </span><span id="id35800904">There is doubtless a connection between
 these outbreaks of electronic activity and the consequent changes in the
 earth's magnetism. </span><span id="id35800908">The precise mechanism of the connection, however, is
 still a matter that is being investigated.</span></p>

				<h1 id="id35800917">Ether and Waves</h1>
			</header>
			<p id="id35800922"><span id="id35800923">The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 called the ether. </span><span id="id35800926">It is true that the notion of the ether has been abandoned
 by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is ultimately dispensed
 with, the conception of the ether has entered so deeply into the scientific
 mind that the science of physics cannot be understood unless we know
 something about the properties attributed to the ether. </span><span id="id35800931">The ether was
 invented to explain the phenomena of light, and to account for the flow of
 energy across empty space. </span><span id="id35800934">Light takes time to travel. </span><span id="id35800936">We see the sun at any
 moment by the light that left it 8 minutes before. </span><span id="id35800939">It has taken that 8
 minutes for the light from the sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which
 separates it from our earth. </span><span id="id35800942" role="pagenum"> [Pg 275] </span> <span id="id35800950">Besides the fact that light takes time to
 travel, it can be shown that light travels in the form of waves.</span><span id="id35800953"> We know that
 sound travels in waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood
 or whatever medium we hear it through. </span><span id="id35800956">If an electric bell be put in a glass
 jar and the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes
 feebler and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 the bell at all. </span><span id="id35800960">Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. </span><span id="id35800963">We continue to <emph>see</emph>
 the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. </span><span id="id35800969">The
 invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether, and
 this ether permeates all space <emph>and all matter</emph>. </span><span id="id35800976">Between us and the
 stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. </span><span id="id35800979">But we see the stars; their
 light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. </span><span id="id35800982">We conceive,
 then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light. </span><span id="id35800984">All the energy
 which has reached the earth from the sun and which, stored for ages in our
 coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and steamships, to heat and
 light our cities, to perform all the multifarious tasks of modern life, was
 conveyed by the ether. </span><span id="id35800989">Without that universal carrier of energy we should
 have nothing but a stagnant, lifeless world.</span></p>
			
			<p id="id35800993"><span id="id35800994">We have said that light consists of waves. </span><span id="id35800996">The ether may be considered as
 resembling, in some respects, a jelly. </span><span id="id35800999">It can transmit vibrations. </span><span id="id35801002">The waves
 of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from crest to crest.</span><span id="id35801005">
 The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a pond is sometimes no
 more than an inch or two. </span><span id="id35801008">This distance is enormously great compared to the
 longest of the wave-lengths that constitute light. </span><span id="id35801011">We say the longest, for
 the waves of light differ in length; the colour depends upon the length of
 the light.</span><span id="id35801014"> Red light has the longest waves and violet the shortest. </span><span id="id35801016">The
 longest waves, the waves of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty
 thousandths of an inch in length (7/250,000 inch). </span><span id="id35801022" role="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span> <span id="id35801020">This is nearly twice the
 length of deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch.</span><span id="id35801029"> But
 light-waves, the waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by
 the ether. </span><span id="id35801032">Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic
 plate, and we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the
 length of the deep-violet waves.</span><span id="id35801036"> Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.</span></p>
