			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>This document, EPUB Accessibility, addresses two key needs in the EPUB® ecosystem:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>discoverability of the accessible qualities of EPUB Publications; and</li>
					<li>evaluation and certification of accessible EPUB Publications.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The provision of accessibility metadata facilitates informed decisions about the usability of an EPUB
					Publication. Consumers can review the qualities of the content and decide whether an EPUB
					Publication is appropriate for their needs, regardless of whether it meets the bar of being
					certified accessible. At a minimum, all EPUB Publications that conform to this document meet the
					accessibility metadata requirements described in <a href="#sec-discovery"></a>.</p>

				<p>Although it has always been possible to create EPUB Publications with a high degree of accessibility,
					this document also sets formal requirements for content to be certified as accessible. These
					requirements provide EPUB Creators a clear set of guidelines to evaluate their content against and
					allow certification of quality. An accessible EPUB Publication is one that meets the accessibility
					requirements as described in <a href="#sec-access-pub"></a>.</p>

				<p>The document also establishes how to identify content that is optimized for specific user needs so
					cannot meet broad accessibility requirements. The requirements for optimized publications are
					described in <a href="#sec-opt-pubs"></a>.</p>

				<p>This document does not target a single version of EPUB. It is designed to be applicable to EPUB
					Publications that conform to any version or profile, including future versions of the standard.</p>

				<p>Ideally, these guidelines will be instructive in evaluating any digital publication built on Open Web
					technologies, although ensuring such application is outside the scope of this document.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For additional background on the decisions that went into this document, refer to <a

				<h3>Success Techniques</h3>

				<p>This document takes an abstract approach to the accessibility requirements for EPUB Publications,
					similar to how WCAG [[WCAG2]] separates its accessibility guidelines from the techniques to achieve
					them. This approach allows the guidelines to remain stable even as the format evolves.</p>

				<p>To facilitate this approach, the companion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/">EPUB
						Accessibility Techniques</a> [[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] document outlines conformance techniques.
					These techniques explain how to meet the requirements of this document for different versions of
					EPUB.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-application" class="informative">
				<h3>Application to Older Versions</h3>

				<p>This document is designed to be applicable to any EPUB Publication, even if the content conforms to
					an older version of EPUB that does not refer to this document (e.g., EPUB 2 [[OPF-201]]).</p>

				<p>Creators of such EPUB Publications are encouraged to create content in conformance with the
					accessibility and discoverability requirements of this document. Upgrading to the latest version of
					EPUB to get access to the most advanced accessibility features and techniques is also
					encouraged.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses the following terminology defined in EPUB 3 [[EPUB-3]]:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB Content Document</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB Creator</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB Publication</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">Media Overlays Document</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">Package Document</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">Reading System</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, it uses the definition of <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-assistive-technologies">assistive technology</a> as
					defined in [[WCAG2]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>An assistive technology is not always a separate application from a Reading System. Reading
						Systems often integrate features of standalone assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech
						playback.</p>

		<section id="sec-discovery">
			<h2>Discoverability</h2>

			<section id="sec-disc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Unlike web pages, EPUB Publications are designed to be distributed through many channels for personal
					consumption — a model that has made EPUB a successful format for ebooks and other types of digital
					publications. A consequence of this model, however, is that specific details about the accessibility
					of a publication need to travel with it.</p>

				<p>An online bookstore aggregating content from publishers and authors, for example, does not know the
					production quality that went into each submission unless the publisher informs them through
					metadata.</p>

				<p>Ensuring that the accessible qualities of an EPUB Publication can be discovered by any interested
					party is therefore a primary concern. Users need to be able to gauge the usability of an EPUB
					Publication when they purchase, borrow, or otherwise obtain it, a determination that requires
					knowing the affordances made to meet the accessibility requirements.</p>

				<p>Similarly, content that does not meet the accessibility requirements of this document does not
					necessarily fail to meet the needs of individual users.</p>

				<p>Only through the provision of rich metadata can a user decide if the content is suitable for
					them.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-disc-package">
				<h3>Package metadata</h3>

				<p>All EPUB Publications MUST include accessibility metadata in the Package Document that exposes their
					accessible properties, regardless of whether the publications also meet the <a
						href="#sec-access-pub">accessibility</a> or <a href="#sec-opt-pubs">optimization</a>
					requirements.</p>

				<p>EPUB Publications MUST include the following accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessMode">Access modes — a human sensory perceptual system or cognitive
							faculty necessary to process or perceive the content (e.g., textual, visual, auditory,
							tactile).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityFeature">Accessibility features — features and adaptations
							that contribute to the overall accessibility of the content (e.g., alternative text,
							extended descriptions, captions).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityHazard">Accessibility hazards — any potential hazards that
							the content presents (e.g., flashing, motion simulation, sound).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilitySummary">Accessibility summary — a human-readable summary of
							the overall accessibility, which includes a description of any known deficiencies (e.g.,
							lack of extended descriptions, specific hazards).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB Publications SHOULD include the following accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessModeSufficient">Sufficient access modes — a set of one or more
							access modes sufficient to consume the content without significant loss of information. An
							EPUB Publication can have more than one set of sufficient access modes for its consumption
							depending on the types of content it includes (i.e., unlike <a
								href="#confreq-schema-accessMode">access modes</a>, this property takes into account any
							affordances for content that is not broadly accessible, such as the inclusion of transcripts
							for audio content).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB Creators MAY include additional accessibility metadata not specified in this section.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#sec-discovery">Discovery Metadata
							Techniques</a> [[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] for more information on these properties and how to
						include them in different versions of EPUB. See also <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#dist-002">DIST-002: Include accessibility

						accessibility metadata in other formats.</p>

			<section id="sec-disc-linked-rec">
				<h3>Linked Metadata Records</h3>

				<p>Accessibility metadata can also be included in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-link-elem"
						>linked records</a> [[EPUB-3]] (i.e., metadata records referenced from <code>link</code>
					elements), but the inclusion of such metadata solely in a linked record does not satisfy the
					discoverability requirements of this document.</p>

			<h2>Accessible Publications</h2>

			<section id="sec-access-pub-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>EPUB is built on the Open Web Platform, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG, the core technologies
					used for content authoring. The use of these technologies means that EPUB Publications can be
					authored with a high degree of accessibility simply through the proper application of established
					web accessibility techniques.</p>

				<p>The primary source for the production of accessible web content is the W3C Web Content Accessibility
					Guidelines (WCAG) [[WCAG2]]. This document leverages the extensive work done in WCAG to establish
					benchmarks for accessible content, and the same four high-level content principles — perceivable,
					operable, understandable, and robust — are central to creating EPUB Publications that are
					accessible.</p>

				<p>This section defines how to apply the conformance criteria defined in WCAG and addresses qualities
					unique to EPUB Publications.</p>

				<p>EPUB Publications authored to comply with the requirements in this section will have a high degree of
					accessibility for users with a wide variety of reading needs and preferences.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-rel-wcag" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to WCAG</h3>

				<p>WCAG [[WCAG2]] and its <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/">associated techniques</a>
					provide extensive coverage of issues and solutions for web content accessibility — from tables to
					embedded multimedia to rich semantics. They represent the foundation that this document builds
					upon.</p>

				<p>This document does not repeat the requirements or techniques introduced in those documents, as it
					risks breaking compatibility between the two standards (e.g., putting guidance out of sync, or in
					conflict). At the same time, although the requirements are not individually called out, it does not
					diminish their importance in creating EPUB Publications that are accessible.</p>

				<p>This document instead defines how to apply WCAG to an EPUB Publication — which is a <a
						href="#sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">collection of web documents</a> as opposed to a single page — and
					adds an <a href="#sec-epub-req">additional set of requirements</a>. These requirements are no more
					or less important than those covered in WCAG; they are simply necessary to follow for EPUB
					Publications. (The relationship to WCAG is explained for each requirement in its respective
					section.)</p>

				<p>The same is true of the techniques in the EPUB Accessibility Techniques document
					[[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]]. It provides coverage of techniques that are unique to EPUB Publications, or
					that need clarification in the context of an EPUB Publication. It does not mean that the rest of the
					WCAG techniques are not applicable.</p>

				<p>As a result, although this section can be read without deep knowledge of WCAG conformance, to
					implement the accessibility requirements of this document will require an understanding of WCAG.</p>

				<p>Because this document adds requirements that are not a part of WCAG, an EPUB Publication can conform
					to WCAG without conforming to this document.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-acc-pub-wcag">
				<h3>WCAG conformance</h3>

				<section id="sec-wcag-conf">
					<h4>WCAG Conformance Requirements</h4>

					<p>To conform to this specification, an EPUB Publication:</p>

					<ul class="conformance-list">
						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-20">MUST meet the requirements of WCAG 2.0 [[WCAG20]], but it is
								strongly RECOMMENDED that it conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/"
									>latest recommended version</a>.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-a">MUST meet the requirements of <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc1">Level A</a>, but it is strongly RECOMMENDED
								that it meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc1">Level AA</a> [[WCAG2]].</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The reporting flexibility offered by these requirements is to ensure that this specification can
						be adapted for use wherever accessibility is mandated but without negating or superseding the
						requirements in effect in any region.</p>

					<p>The baseline requirement for WCAG 2.0 Level A, for example, is primarily intended to provide EPUB
						Creators backwards compatibility for older content and flexibility to encourage adoption of
						accessible production where no formal requirements exist. It is not generally recognized as
						providing a high degree of accessibility.</p>

					<p>Ideally, EPUB Creators should try to conform to the latest version of WCAG at Level AA, but the
						formal thresholds they must meet will be defined by local and national laws, or by procurer or
						distributor requirements.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Examples of legislative requirements for accessibility include the <a
								href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
								2019/882</a> in the European Union and <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/"
								>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> in the United States. EPUB
							Publications will need to meet more than just the basic Level A success criteria to be
							compliant with these laws.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Keeping pace with WCAG has the benefit of continuously enhancing access for users. As web
						technologies change and improve, and awareness of conditions that impede access evolve, new
						requirements are added to the standard. Meeting these additional requirements helps ensure EPUB
						Publications employ the most up-to-date techniques. Meeting the requirements of older versions,
						while still helpful, can result in a less optimal reading experience.</p>

					<p>Similarly, Level AA conformance is often cited as the benchmark for accessibility in legal
						frameworks and policies. The reason for this is that it provides the greatest range of
						improvements that can realistically be implemented (EPUB Creators are encouraged to try and meet
						the AAA requirements if they can, but fully conforming at AAA is typically not possible). Only
						meeting level A requires compromises for various user groups that can again result in a less
						optimal reading experience.</p>

				<section id="sec-wcag-eval">
					<h4>Evaluating WCAG Conformance</h4>

					<section id="sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">
						<h5>Page and Publication</h5>

						<p>The WCAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance">principles</a>
							[[WCAG2]] focus on the evaluation of individual web pages, but an EPUB Publication more
							closely resembles what WCAG refers to as a <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-set-of-web-pages">set of web pages</a>: "[a]
							collection of Web pages that share a common purpose" [[WCAG2]].</p>

						<p>Consequently, when evaluating the accessibility of an EPUB Publication, individual pages — or
							Content Documents, as they are known in EPUB 3 — cannot be reviewed in isolation. Rather,
							their overall accessibility as parts of a larger work also MUST be evaluated.</p>

						<p>For example, it is not sufficient for individual EPUB Content Documents to have a logical
							reading order if the publication presents them in the wrong order. Likewise, including a
							title for every EPUB Content Document is complementary to providing a title for the
							publication: the overall accessibility is affected if either is missing.</p>

						<p>The WCAG guidelines for content to be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust
							therefore MUST be evaluated against the full EPUB Publication, not only to each Content
							Document within it.</p>

						<p>More information about applying these guidelines to EPUB Publications is available in the
							EPUB Accessibility Techniques [[?EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]].</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-wcag-application">
						<h5>Applying the Conformance Criteria</h5>

						<p>When evaluating an EPUB Publication, the WCAG <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#conformance-reqs">conformance criteria</a> [[WCAG2]]
							are applied as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>When determining compliance with a conformance level, the whole EPUB Publication MUST
								meet the conformance requirements of the level claimed.</li>

							<li>EPUB Creators MUST NOT use EPUB's fallback mechanisms to provide a <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming
									alternate version</a> [[WCAG2]], as there is no reliable way for users to access
								such fallbacks. If fallbacks are used, both the primary content and its fallback(s) MUST
								meet the requirements for the conformance level claimed. EPUB-specific fallback
								mechanisms include <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-foreign-restrictions-manifest">manifest
									fallbacks</a> [[EPUB-3]], <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-opf-bindings"
									>bindings</a> [[EPUB-3]] and content switching via the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-xhtml-content-switch"><code>epub:switch</code>
									element</a> [[EPUB-3]].</li>

							<li>When determining compliance with the "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc2">Full
									Pages</a>" requirement [[WCAG2]] (i.e., that parts of a page cannot be excluded when
								making a conformance claim), the entirety of each EPUB Content Document MUST achieve the
								conformance level <em>and</em> every Content Document in the EPUB Publication MUST meet
								the stated conformance level.</li>
						</ul>

				<h3>EPUB Requirements</h3>

				<section id="sec-page-nav">
					<h4>Page Navigation</h4>

					<section id="sec-page-nav-overview" class="informative">
						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>Statically paginated content is still ubiquitous, as print continues to be the most consumed
							medium for books both among the general reading public and in educational settings. Print is
							not the only source of static pagination, either: static page boundaries are also present in
							fixed-layout digital publications.</p>

						<p>As a result, non-visual readers in an environment where statically paginated content is used
							are disadvantaged relative to their peers by not being able to easily locate the same
							locations in the publication (e.g., if a teacher instructs students to all turn to a
							specific page).</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page boundary locations helps bridge this disparity by ensuring that those
							using reflowable media are not disadvantaged by their choice.</p>

						<p>Providing page navigation also helps in reflowable publications that do not have a statically
							paginated equivalent. The default pagination of these publications by Reading Systems is not
							static since it changes depending on the viewport size and user's font settings. As a
							result, coordinating locations among users of the same EPUB Publication can be complicated
							without static references.</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page navigation represents one method of achieving the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#multiple-ways">Multiple Ways success criterion</a>
							[[WCAG2]], as it provides another meaningful way for users to access the content (e.g., in
							addition to the table of contents, linear reading order and any other navigation aids).</p>

						<p>Given the importance of page navigation in mixed print/digital environments, the requirement
							to include this feature has higher precedence than it would be given solely as one of many
							ways to meet the Multiple Ways success criterion.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#sec-epub-page-markers">Page
									Markers</a> [[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] for more information on the inclusion of page
								navigation in EPUB Publications.</p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-page-nav-applicability">
						<h5>Applicability</h5>

						<p>An EPUB Publication SHOULD include the page navigation objectives defined in this section in
							whenever any of the following cases is true:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>the EPUB Publication is identified as the dynamically paginated equivalent of a
								statically paginated publication (e.g., included in a print/digital bundle);</li>

							<li>the EPUB Publication is offered as an alternative to a statically paginated publication
								in an environment where the use of both versions can be reasonably predicted (e.g.,
								education); or</li>

							<li>the EPUB Publication and a statically paginated publication are generated from a
								workflow that allows the retention of page break locations across formats.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>EPUB Creators MAY include page navigation in reflowable EPUB Publications without statically
							paginated equivalents.</p>

					<h4>Media Overlays Playback</h4>

					<section id="sec-mo-overview" class="informative">
						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>Media Overlays provide an accessible playback experience for anyone who benefits from having
							text and audio synchronized. They are also useful to users who only require audio playback,
							or only benefit from reading with text highlighting. Media Overlays also enable a seamless
							playback experience from beginning to end of an EPUB Publication for all these users.</p>

						<p>The most basic <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-overlays-def">Media Overlay
								Documents</a> [[EPUB-3]] provide only minimal instructions to Reading Systems, however.
							They indicate the text to highlight and the audio clip that corresponds to the text. The
							result is that users only have basic start and stop options available.</p>

						<p>EPUB Creators need to add structure and semantics to media overlay documents to allow Reading
							Systems to present more usable experiences. With richer markup, a Reading System could
							provide the ability to skip past secondary content that interferes with the primary
							narrative, escape users from deeply nested structures like tables, and allow them to
							navigate through the sections of the publication without having to go to the table of
							contents.</p>

						<p>Adding structure and semantics to Media Overlay Documents broadly falls under the objective
							of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#info-and-relationships">Info and Relationships
								success criterion</a> [[WCAG2]]. Without structured and semantically meaningful playback
							sequences, the effect is to deprive users of rich navigation of the content.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-mo-applicability">
						<h5>Applicability</h5>

						<p>Media Overlay Documents MUST meet the requirements in [[EPUB-3]]. It is not necessary to meet
							any additional requirements beyond those defined in [[EPUB-3]] to be conformant with this

								<dt id="sec-mo-order-understand">Understanding this Objective</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Every EPUB Publication has a default reading order that allows users to logically
										progress through the content. It ensures that readers are able to follow the
										primary narrative and also that secondary content is encountered where it makes
										the most sense. The default reading order also establishes some less obvious
										relations, like the progress within a table from cell to cell and row to
										row.</p>
									<p>If the sequence of <code>par</code> and <code>seq</code> elements in a Media
										Overlay Documents does not match this progression, it can cause confusion for
										readers, whether they are only listening to the audio or trying to also follow
										visually.</p>
									<p>Ordering the playback to match the default reading order is the safest way to
										ensure that users can follow the text. In some cases, however, strict adherence
										to this practice could result in a suboptimal reading experience (e.g., playback
										of a table by column instead of row might make more logical sense in some
										cases). The goal of this objective is not to forbid alternate presentations, but
										to ensure that any deviations retain the logical flow of the content.</p>

				<h3>Conformance Reporting</h3>

				<section id="sec-conf-reporting-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>Conformance reporting is achieved through the expression of metadata properties in the EPUB
						Package Document.</p>

					<p>This metadata establishes both:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the <a href="#sec-conf-reporting-pub">level of conformance achieved</a>; and</li>
						<li>information about <a href="#sec-conf-reporting-eval">who performed the evaluation</a>.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The metadata uses a combination of properties from DCMI Metadata Terms [[DCTERMS]] and the <a
							href="#app-a11y-vocab">EPUB Accessibility Vocabulary</a>, as explained in more detail in the
						following sections.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-conf-reporting-pub">
					<h4>Publication Conformance</h4>

					<p>To indicate that an EPUB Publication conforms to the accessibility requirements of this document,
						it MUST include a <code>conformsTo</code> property whose value MUST exactly match (i.e., both in
						case and spacing) the following pattern:</p>

					<p class="conf-pattern">EPUB Accessibility <a href="#acc-ver"><var>A11Y-VER</var></a> + WCAG <a
							href="#wcag-ver"><var>WCAG-VER</var></a> Level <a href="#wcag-lvl"

					<p><i>where:</i></p>

					<dl class="varlist">
						<dt id="acc-ver"><var>A11Y-VER</var></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>MUST be the version number of the EPUB Accessibility specification the publication
								conforms to. For the purpose of this specification, this value MUST be
								<code>1.1</code>.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="wcag-ver"><var>WCAG-VER</var></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>MUST be the version number of WCAG the publication conforms to (e.g., <code>2.0</code> or
									<code>2.1</code>).</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="wcag-lvl"><var>WCAG-LVL</var></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>MUST be the WCAG conformance level the publication conforms to (e.g., <code>A</code> or
									<code>AA</code>).</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>The following conformance strings are valid as of publication of this document:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>EPUB Accessibility 1.1 + WCAG 2.0 Level A</li>
						<li>EPUB Accessibility 1.1 + WCAG 2.0 Level AA</li>

						<li>EPUB Accessibility 1.1 + WCAG 2.1 Level AA</li>
						<li>EPUB Accessibility 1.1 + WCAG 2.1 Level AAA</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This list will change as new versions of WCAG are released. For new versions of [[WCAG2]], only
						the digit after the "2." should change from the above patterns.</p>

					<h4>Re-Evaluating Conformance</h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is intended to help determine when a new evaluation is necessary. It
							is not required to be followed to conform with this specification.</p>
					</div>

					<p>How long a conformance evaluation of an EPUB Publication is good for is complex question. Unlike
						web sites, which are continuously evolving, an EPUB Publication may never be updated again once
						it is published. As a result, an unmodified EPUB Publication will always conform to its last
						evaluation.</p>

					<p>It is common in publishing, however, to release updated versions of an EPUB Publication when
						errors and typos are found in the work, as well as to periodically release new editions. Not all
						of the changes made to an EPUB Publication will substantively change its accessibility
						complicating the question of when a new evaluation is required or whether a full or partial
						re-evaluation will do.</p>

					<p>As a general rule, EPUB Creators must re-evaluate their content whenever substantive changes are
						made to the structure and functionality of an EPUB Publication, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>modifications to the nature or order of markup in EPUB Content Documents;</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to images that convey information;</li>
						<li>modifications to formatting that affects the readability (e.g., contrast); and</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to interactive controls, forms, etc.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If the EPUB Publication includes substantively the same markup and content as the previous
						release, only an evaluation of the changes may be necessary to re-confirm conformance.</p>

					<p>If an updated version of this specification or [[WCAG]] has been published since the last time an
						EPUB Publication was released, however, it is also recommended to perform a new evaluation to
						ensure conformance to the latest standards. A full re-evaluation still may not be necessary
						(i.e., only new or modified success criteria may need to be checked unless the standards undergo
						major changes to methodology or conformance).</p>

					<p>Conversely, a re-evaluation is typically not required when non-substantive changes are made, such
						as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>fixes for typographic errors in the text (i.e., no markup is changed);</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to decorative images;</li>
						<li>modifications to formatting that does not affect the understanding of the content or change
							how the text is displayed (e.g., padding); and</li>
						<li>modifications to Package Document metadata.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The determination of whether a change is substantive or not should be made by an individual
						qualified to assess the accessibility of EPUB Publications. An editor, for example, may not
						realize the impact of seemingly minor formatting changes.</p>

					<p>Even in the case of non-substantive changes, an updated evaluation (full or partial) is
						recommended if the accessibility standards have changed.</p>

					<p>EPUB Creators are encouraged to consider even more progressive approaches than those described
						here. Waiting for content changes before reviewing and updating the accessibility of EPUB
						Publications can leave them lacking recent improvements. For example, a publisher might
						prioritize periodic reviews of their top-selling EPUB Publications to ensure they remain
						maximally usable to the widest possible audience.</p>

			<h2>Optimized Publications</h2>

			<p>Although WCAG [[WCAG2]] provides a general set of guidelines for making content broadly accessible,
				conformant content is not always optimal for specific user groups. Conversely, content optimized for a
				specific need or reading modality is often not conformant to WCAG because it is not designed for a broad
				audience.</p>

			<p>For example, an EPUB Publication with synchronized text and audio can contain a full audio recording of
				the content but limit the text content to only the major headings. In this case, the EPUB Publication is
				consumable by users who needs to hear the content (i.e., they can listen to the full publication and can
				navigate between headings), but it is not usable by anyone who cannot hear the audio.</p>

			<p>In other words, when an EPUB Publication is optimized for specific reading modalities, the failure to
				achieve a WCAG conformance level does not make it any less accessible to the intended audience.</p>

			<p>An EPUB Publication that has been optimized MUST identify the standard or guidelines the content adheres
				to in a <code>conformsTo</code> property in accordance with [[DCTERMS]]. The value of this property MUST
				be a URL in accordance with [[URL]] that references the standard or guidelines it follows.</p>

			<aside class="example">
				<p>The following example shows a conformance statement for an EPUB 3 Publication that conforms to the

			<aside class="example">

			<h2>Distribution</h2>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Although it is not required to follow the recommendations in this section to conform to this
					specification, some jurisdictions require these practices be followed. <a
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
						2019/882</a>, for example, includes similar requirements for digital publications distributed in
					the European Union.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The creation of accessible EPUB Publications does not guarantee that the publication will be obtainable
				or consumable by users in an accessible fashion. Depending on how the EPUB Publication is distributed,
				other factors will influence its overall accessibility. For example, an accessible interface for
				locating and obtaining content is an essential part of the distribution process, as is the ability to
				search and review accessibility metadata.</p>

			<p>While much of the distribution process is outside the control of EPUB Creators, so outside the scope of
				this specification, there are factors an EPUB Creator can control. For example, while an EPUB Creator
				typically does not control the accessibility of the digital rights management (DRM) scheme applied to
				their EPUB Publications, they do control what usage rights to apply to their EPUB Publications. So even
				though a DRM scheme may allow an Author to block access to the text of the publication, the EPUB Creator
				needs to take care not to apply such a restriction as it could block the ability for assistive
				technologies to read the text aloud.</p>

			<p>To minimize the effects of distribution on accessibility, EPUB Creators are therefore advised to adhere
				to the following distribution practices:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>they must not impose restrictions that impair access by assistive technologies; and</li>
				<li>they must include accessibility metadata in the record format required for distribution of an EPUB
					Publication (e.g., [[ONIX]] or [[MARC21]]) when such metadata is supported by the format.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="note">
				<p>A distributor may implement a digital rights management scheme that inherently impairs accessibility
					through no fault of the EPUB Creator. Following the guidance in this section does not restrict EPUB
					Creators from using such distributors. The intent is only that the EPUB Creator not impair
					accessibility by activating a feature that that would normally not be active.</p>
