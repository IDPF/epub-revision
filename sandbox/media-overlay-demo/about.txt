= Sample content =
== Source ==
Built from excerpts from "The Outline of Science by J Arthur Thompson", the text and audio of which are available on Project Gutenberg and Librivox, respectively.  Some formatting modifications and media additions were made.  

== Fileset == 
In the book/ directory:

 * science.opf: the package file
 * science.html: the main text file
 * science_audio_overlay.smil: the audio script
 * style.css : author-defined publication style
 * science.mp3: the actual audio version of the book
 * img/ : image and video resources


= Demo player implementation =

== Running the demo ==
Copy the files to your webserver (could be localhost) and open reader.html from a browser.  Right now, this demo only works with Chrome or Safari, due to their MP3 audio support.

== Fileset ==
In the webapp/ directory:

 * reader.html: the main reader application
 * smil.js: the smil playback module
 * util.js: utility functions
 * jquery: third-party library, freely available and commonly used in javascript applications

== Features ==
Synchronized text/audio playback
Click on the screen to change the playback position
"Skippability" support
On-screen controls
Phrase navigation
Volume and timescale control

= Implementation notes =

Errors and other messages are sent to console.error and console.log, respectively.  Firebug does the right thing with them.

By default, "skippable" items (such as page numbers, sidebars, and footnotes) will be played until they are unchecked.

= Issues =

 * svg does not load nicely from a web server

= Future additions =

 * Fast-forward and rewind
 * Previous phrase navigation
 * NCX-style navigation
 * Buttons should be keyboard-accessible via access key (depends on @accesskey implementation)
 * insert resource words into audio (e.g. "sidebar start", "footnote start", "footnote reference")
