= Sample content =
== Source ==
Built from excerpts from "The Outline of Science by J Arthur Thompson", the text and audio of which are available on Project Gutenberg and Librivox, respectively.  Some formatting modifications and media additions were made.  

== Fileset == 
In the book/ directory:

 * science.opf: the package file
 * science.ncx: the navigation file (not currently used by the implementation)
 * science.html: the main text file
 * science_audio_overlay.smil: the audio script
 * style.css : author-defined publication style
 * science.mp3: the actual audio version of the book
 * img/ : image and video resources


= Demo player implementation =

== Running the demo ==
Copy the files to your webserver (could be localhost) and open reader.html from a browser.  Right now, this demo only works with Chrome or Safari, due to their MP3 audio support.

== Fileset ==
In the webapp/ directory:

 * reader.html: the main reader application
 * smil.js: the smil playback module
 * util.js: utility functions
 * jquery: third-party library, freely available and commonly used in javascript applications

== Features ==
Synchronized text/audio playback
Click on the screen to change the playback position
"Skippability" support
On-screen controls
Phrase navigation
Volume and timescale control

= Implementation notes =

There is a DB table (client-side SQL storage) for tracking SMIL IDs and the corresponding @textref (for seqs) or par/text/@src (for pars).  It therefore only works in Webkit browsers right now.  Testing has been done with Google Chrome.  This could easily be replaced by a pure javascript map instead of a DB.  Implementors will want to choose what is fastest for their target environment.

Errors and other messages are sent to console.error and console.log, respectively.  Firebug does the right thing with them.

By default, "skippable" items (such as page numbers, sidebars, and footnotes) will be played until they are unchecked.

= Issues =
You need to press play before being able to click around the screen.  If you click anywhere before pressing play, the audio nodes have trouble (?!) and it skips ahead to where there is a new audio file (in this case, the sidebar).  A UI workaround is in place, but it doesn't solve the audio clipping problem (a well-complained-about HTML5 issue in Chrome/Safari).

= Future additions =

 * Fast-forward and rewind
 * Previous phrase navigation
 * NCX-style navigation
 * Buttons should be keyboard-accessible via access key (depends on @accesskey implementation)
 * Parse OPF
 * insert resource words into audio (e.g. "sidebar start", "footnote start", "footnote reference")
