<p class="float">This region has region-overlap set to "float". This
is the default value. It also has background-color set to yellow. </p>
<p class="overlap">This region has region-overlap set to "overlap". It also
has background-color set to cyan, z-index set to 1 and opacity set to 0.8
so that it is possible to see the effect.</p>
<p class="clear">This region has region-overlap set to "clear". It also
has background-color set to pink. This is similar to float and clear
specified together.</p>
<p>This is the main body text. It will flow around region for which
region-overlap is set to "float" and it will clear the region for which
region-overlap is set to "clear". It won't be affected by a region
